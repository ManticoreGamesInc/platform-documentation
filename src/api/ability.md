Ability

## Description

Abilities are CoreObjects that can be added to Players and guide the Player's animation in sync with the Ability's state machine. Spawn an Ability with `World.SpawnAsset()` or add an Ability as a child of an Equipment/Weapon to have it be assigned to the Player automatically when that item is equipped.

Abilities can be activated by association with an Action Binding. Their internal state machine flows through the phases: Ready, Cast, Execute, Recovery and Cooldown. An Ability begins in the Ready state and transitions to Cast when its Binding (e.g. Left mouse click) is activated by the owning player. It then automatically flows from Cast to Execute, then Recovery and finally Cooldown. At each of these state transitions it fires a corresponding event.

Only one ability can be active at a time. By default, activating an ability will interrupt the currently active ability. The `canBePrevented` and `preventsOtherAbilities` properties can be used to customize interruption rules for competing abilities.

If an ability is interrupted during the Cast phase, it will immediately reset to the Ready state. If an ability is interrupted during the Execute or Recovery phase, the ability will immediately transition to the Cooldown phase.

## Examples 

### Ability.castEvent

The Cast phase begins as soon as an ability is activated. By checking if the player casting the ability `isGrounded` we can create an effect that propels you upwards, but it doesn't work if you are already jumping or flying. We detect this is the `castEvent`, which is early enough for an `Interrupt()` to reset the ability.

```lua
    local ability = script.parent

    function OnCast(ability)
        if ability.owner.isGrounded then
            ability.owner:SetVelocity(Vector3.UP * 2000)
        else
            ability:Interrupt()
        end
    end

    ability.castEvent:Connect(OnCast)
```

### Ability.cooldownEvent

In this example, a fighting game has an "invincible" mechanic where player attacks are not interrupted while they have this effect. Some powerful attacks make the player invincible during the entire active cycle of the ability. The effect is gained at the beginning of the cast phase and is removed at the end of the recovery phase, before the cooldown begins. The resource system is used in keeping track of the invincibility effect.

```lua
    local ability = script.parent

    function OnCast(ability)
        ability.owner:AddResource("invincible", 1)
    end

    function OnCooldown(ability)
        ability.owner:RemoveResource("invincible", 1)
    end

    ability.castEvent:Connect(OnCast)
    ability.cooldownEvent:Connect(OnCooldown)
```

### Ability.executeEvent

Weapons implement lots of built-in gameplay that doesn't require any scripting, such as attack and reload abilities. However, they can be augmented with additional mechanics. In this example, a special sound effect is played when a weapon shoots while low on ammunition. The script expects to be a child of a weapon's "Shoot" ability.

```lua
    local ability = script.parent
    local weapon = script:FindAncestorByType('Weapon')
    local lowAmmoSound = script:GetCustomProperty("LowAmmoSound")

    local LOW_AMMO_PERCENTAGE = 0.2

    function OnExecute(ability)
        if weapon.currentAmmo / weapon.maxAmmo <= LOW_AMMO_PERCENTAGE then
            World.SpawnAsset(lowAmmoSound, {position = weapon:GetWorldPosition()})
        end
    end

    ability.executeEvent:Connect(OnExecute)
```

### Ability.interruptedEvent

The `interruptedEvent` fires when an ability is going through it's activation process and `Interrupt()` is called on it, or if it becomes disabled. In this example, interruption is a key part of the game design, so a visual effect is spawned at the player's position to help communicate the interaction between players.

```lua
    local ability = script.parent
    local interruptedVfx = script:GetCustomProperty("InterruptedVfx")

    function OnInterrupted(ability)
        if Object.IsValid(ability.owner) then
            World.SpawnAsset(interruptedVfx, {position = ability.owner:GetWorldPosition()})
        end
    end

    ability.interruptedEvent:Connect(OnInterrupted)
```

### Ability.readyEvent

The Ready phase begins when an ability comes off cooldown and is "ready" to be used again. In this example, we create an invisibility effect that takes advantage of the `readyEvent`, leveraging the cooldown duration of the ability as a clock to determine when to make the player visible again.

```lua
    local ability = script.parent

    function OnExecute(ability)
        -- Hide the player
        ability.owner:SetVisibility(false)
    end

    function OnReady(ability)
        -- Show the player
        ability.owner:SetVisibility(true)
    end

    ability.readyEvent:Connect(OnReady)
    ability.executeEvent:Connect(OnExecute)
```

### Ability.recoveryEvent

The `recoveryEvent` marks the end of an ability's Execute phase and the beginning of its Recovery phase. In this example, a melee punch ability has a trigger that causes damage to enemies who overlap it. For it to work the trigger is only enabled for a brief moment, during the Execute phase.

```lua
    local ability = script.parent
    local trigger = script:GetCustomProperty("ImpactTrigger"):WaitForObject()
    trigger.collision = Collision.FORCE_OFF

    local DAMAGE_AMOUNT = 10

    function OnExecute(ability)
        trigger.collision = Collision.FORCE_ON
    end

    function OnRecovery(ability)
        trigger.collision = Collision.FORCE_OFF
    end

    ability.executeEvent:Connect(OnExecute)
    ability.recoveryEvent:Connect(OnRecovery)

    function OnBeginOverlap(trigger, other)
        -- Only damage enemy players
        if other:IsA("Player") and other.team ~= ability.owner.team then
            other:ApplyDamage(Damage.New(DAMAGE_AMOUNT))
        end
    end

    trigger.beginOverlapEvent:Connect(OnBeginOverlap)
```

### Ability.tickEvent

Abilities fire the `tickEvent` while they are active or on cooldown (not on Ready state). In this example, a piece of equipment carries several abilities, but we want to do a common update logic on all of them. Note: `Ability.tickEvent` works somewhat differently from a `Tick()` function - `tickEvent` is an actual event that just happens to fire once per tick. Each invocation of the callback runs on its own task. This means that, unlike `Tick()`, there is no guarantee that it will wait for the previous `tickEvent` to finish before starting the next one. This means you can't use things like `Task.Wait()` to add time between ticks!

```lua
    local equipment = script.parent
    local allAbilities = equipment:GetAbilities()

    function OnTick(ability, deltaTime)
        print("Updating ability " .. ability.name)
    end

    for _,ability in ipairs(allAbilities) do
        ability.tickEvent:Connect(OnTick)
    end
```

### Ability.Activate

The Ability `Activate()` function is client-only, behaving as if the player had pressed the key binding. In order for a server gameplay decision to result in an ability activation, it must be communicated over the network somehow. In this example, a trigger overlap is representative of an arbitrary gameplay decision on the server. A broadcast message is sent to the client, who receives the event and activates the ability.

Server script:

```lua
    local trigger = script.parent

    trigger.beginOverlapEvent(function(trigger, other)
        if other:IsA("Player") then
            Events.BroadcastToPlayer(other, "SteppedOnObject")
        end
    end)

--[[#description
        Client context script under the ability:
]]
    local ability = script:FindAncestorByType("Ability")

    function OnPlayAnimation()
        if ability.owner and ability.owner == Game.GetLocalPlayer() then
            ability:Activate()
        end
    end

    Events.Connect("SteppedOnObject", OnPlayAnimation)
```

### Ability.GetCurrentPhase

### Ability.GetPhaseTimeRemaining

In this example, while the ability is on cooldown the percent completion of the cooldown is calculated. This could be useful, for instance, in displaying user interface.

```lua
    local ability = script:FindAncestorByType("Ability")

    function Tick()
        if ability:GetCurrentPhase() == AbilityPhase.COOLDOWN then
            local duration = ability.cooldownPhaseSettings.duration
            local remaining = ability:GetPhaseTimeRemaining()
            local percent = 100 * (1 - remaining / duration)

            print("Cooldown remaining: %" .. string.format("%.2f",percent))
        end
    end
```

### Ability.GetTargetData

### Ability.SetTargetData

The ability's targeting data gives a lot of information about where and what the player is aiming at. If setup correctly, it can also be modified programatically. In this example, the Z position of the target is flattened horizontally. Useful, for example, in a top-down shooter. For this to work it should be placed in a client context under the ability. The ability should also have the option "Is Target Data Update" turned off for the Execute phase, otherwise any data set programatically will be overwritten when the phase changes.

```lua
    local ability = script:FindAncestorByType("Ability")

    function OnCast(ability)
        local abilityTarget = ability:GetTargetData()
        local pos = abilityTarget:GetHitPosition()

        pos.z = ability.owner:GetWorldPosition().z + 50

        abilityTarget:SetHitPosition(pos)
        ability:SetTargetData(abilityTarget)
    end

    ability.castEvent:Connect(OnCast)
```

### Ability.Interrupt

Interrupting an ability either sends it back into ready state (if it was still in the Cast phase) or puts it on cooldown. In this example, we have an ability that searches for all enemies in a 10 meter radius and interrupts their abilities.

```lua
    local ability = script.parent
    local RADIUS = 1000 -- 10 meters

    function OnExecute(ability)
        local center = ability.owner:GetWorldPosition()
        -- Search for enemies
        local enemies = Game.FindPlayersInCylinder(center, RADIUS, {ignoreTeams = ability.owner.team})
        for _, enemy in ipairs(enemies) do
            -- Interrupt all their abilities
            local enemyAbilities = enemy:GetAbilities()
            for _,a in ipairs(enemyAbilities) do
                a:Interrupt()
            end
        end
    end

    ability.executeEvent:Connect(OnExecute)
```

### Ability.animation

In this example, the `ProcessAbilities()` function can be called once, such as at the beginning of a round, to take inventory of a player's abilities and classify them based on animation. This example also demonstrates how to disconnect event listeners so that we don't listen for the same event multiple times.

```lua
    function OnMelee1HandCast(ability)
        print("One-handed melee attack")
    end

    function OnMelee2HandCast(ability)
        print("Two-handed melee attack")
    end

    local abilityEventListeners = {}

    function CleanupListeners(player)
        -- If we have previously processed this player, cleanup all listeners
        if abilityEventListeners[player] then
            for i, eventListener in ipairs(abilityEventListeners[player]) do
                eventListener:Disconnect()
            end
            abilityEventListeners[player] = nil
        end
    end

    function ProcessAbilities(player)
        CleanupListeners(player)

        local allAbilities = player:GetAbilities()

        for _, ability in ipairs(allAbilities) do
            if string.match(ability.animation, "melee") then
                local eventListener
                if string.match(ability.animation, "1h") then
                    eventListener = ability.castEvent:Connect(OnMelee1HandCast)
                else
                    eventListener = ability.castEvent:Connect(OnMelee2HandCast)
                end
                table.insert(abilityEventListeners[player], eventListener)
            end
        end
    end

    -- Lets also cleanup when a player leaves the game, as perhaps their ability objects might stay in the game.
    Game.playerLeftEvent:Connect(CleanupListeners)
```

### Ability.canActivateWhileDead

Some games may have abilities that can be used while the player is dead. In this example, we have abilities that can **only** be activated while dead. If not dead, then it's interrupted.

```lua
    local ability = script:FindAncestorByType("Ability")

    function OnCast(ability)
        if ability.canActivateWhileDead and not ability.owner.isDead then
            ability:Interrupt()
        end
    end

    ability.castEvent:Connect(OnCast)

--[[#description
        On the client context, a user interface component that displays ability details is hidden until the player dies:
]]
    local abilityCanvas = script:GetCustomProperty("Canvas")
    local BINDING = script:GetCustomProperty("Binding")

    function Tick(deltaTime)
        local ability = GetLocalPlayerAbilityWithBinding()

        if ability
        and ability.isEnabled
        and ability.canActivateWhileDead
        and ability.owner
        and ability.owner.isDead then

            abilityCanvas.visibility = Visibility.INHERIT
        else
            abilityCanvas.visibility = Visibility.FORCE_OFF
        end
    end

    -- Searches the local player's abilities until one with a matching action binding is found
    -- The BINDING search criteria should be set in the custom property
    function GetLocalPlayerAbilityWithBinding()
        local abilities = Game.GetLocalPlayer():GetAbilities()
        for _, ability in pairs(abilities) do
            if ability.actionBinding == BINDING then
                return ability
            end
        end

        return nil
    end
```

### Ability.canBePrevented

In this example, an ability recognizes that it has been interrupted by the activation of another, special ability, that is setup to serve for animation cancelling. The `canBePrevented` property is usually true in this game, but in this special case it has been configured as false so that it can be activated at any time. The player gains vertical impulse as result of the synergy and hears a small audio cue that helps communicate the mechanic.

```lua
    local ability = script.parent
    local cancelSound = script:GetCustomProperty("CancelSound")

    function OnInterrupted(ability)
        local player = ability.owner
        if not Object.IsValid(player) then return end

        for _, a in ipairs(player:GetAbilities()) do
            if a:GetCurrentPhase() ~= AbilityPhase.READY and not a.canBePrevented then
                player:AddImpulse(Vector3.UP * 1000)
                World.SpawnAsset(cancelSound, {position = player:GetWorldPosition()})
                return
            end
        end
    end

    ability.interruptedEvent:Connect(OnInterrupted)
```

### Ability.castPhaseSettings

### Ability.executePhaseSettings

### Ability.recoveryPhaseSettings

### Ability.cooldownPhaseSettings

In this example, a function in a client context script can be called to show the elapsed times for an ability. The UI Text it controls displays how many seconds are remaining in the current phase, and the color of the text blends from black to white to indicate the percentage of completion. Although the Execute and Recovery phases are actually separate, they are here presented to the player as a single phase.

```lua
    local COUNTDOWN_TEXT = script:GetCustomProperty("CountdownText"):WaitForObject()

    function UpdateForAbility(ability)
        local currentPhase = ability:GetCurrentPhase()

        local percent = 1
        local cooldownText = "Ready"

        if currentPhase ~= AbilityPhase.READY then
            local phaseDuration
            local timeRemaining = ability:GetPhaseTimeRemaining()

            if currentPhase == AbilityPhase.CAST then
                phaseDuration = ability.castPhaseSettings.duration
            elseif currentPhase == AbilityPhase.EXECUTE then
                -- In the case of Execute and Recovery phases, we can show those as a single one
                local recoveryD = ability.recoveryPhaseSettings.duration
                phaseDuration = ability.executePhaseSettings.duration + recoveryD
                timeRemaining = timeRemaining + recoveryD
            elseif currentPhase == AbilityPhase.RECOVERY then
                phaseDuration = ability.recoveryPhaseSettings.duration
            else --currentPhase == AbilityPhase.COOLDOWN
                phaseDuration = ability.cooldownPhaseSettings.duration
            end

            if phaseDuration > 0 then
                percent = 1 - timeRemaining / phaseDuration
            end
            cooldownText = string.format("%.1f", timeRemaining)
        end

        COUNTDOWN_TEXT.text = cooldownText

        local c = Color.Lerp(Color.BLACK, Color.WHITE, percent)
        COUNTDOWN_TEXT:SetColor(c)
    end
```

### Ability.isEnabled

In this example, an equipment is setup with multiple abilities that all use the same action binding. This script cycles through the abilities, making sure only one is enabled at a time. The `owner` property is cleared for the previous ability and set for the next one, as part of ensuring the correct one activates when the binding is pressed.

```lua
    local equipment = script:FindAncestorByType("Equipment")
    local abilities = {}
    local abilityIndex = 1

    function OnAbilityRecovery(ability)
        if (#abilities > 1) then
            abilities[abilityIndex].isEnabled = false
            abilities[abilityIndex].owner = nil

            abilityIndex = abilityIndex + 1
            if (abilityIndex > #abilities) then
                abilityIndex = 1
            end

            abilities[abilityIndex].isEnabled = true
            abilities[abilityIndex].owner = equipment.owner
        end
    end

    for _, child in pairs(equipment:FindDescendantsByType("Ability")) do
        table.insert(abilities, child)

        child.isEnabled = (#abilities == 1)

        child.recoveryEvent:Connect(OnAbilityRecovery)
    end
```

### Ability.name

### Ability.actionBinding

Even though some API properties are read-only, they are useful is solutions such as user interface. In this example, a client context script searches the local player's list of abilities to find one that matches the action binding (input) designated for this UI component. When it's found, the ability's name is written to the UI Text object.

```lua
    local BINDING = script:GetCustomProperty("Binding")
    local NAME_UI = script:GetCustomProperty("NameUIText"):WaitForObject()

    function GetLocalPlayerAbilityWithBinding()
        local player = Game.GetLocalPlayer()
        local abilities = player:GetAbilities()

        for _, ability in pairs(abilities) do
            if ability.actionBinding == BINDING then
                return ability
            end
        end

        return nil
    end

    function Tick()
        local ability = GetLocalPlayerAbilityWithBinding()
        if ability then
            NAME_UI.text = ability.name
        end
    end
```

### Ability.owner

Usually, abilities are presented as part of an equipment, but that isn't a requirement. In this example, when new players join the game they are assigned an ability through the use of the `owner` property.

```lua
    local abilityTemplate = script:GetCustomProperty("AbilityTemplate")

    function OnPlayerJoined(player)
        local ability = World.SpawnAsset(abilityTemplate)
        ability.owner = player
    end

    Game.playerJoinedEvent:Connect(OnPlayerJoined)
```
