## Examples

### Vector3.Lerp

Vector3.Lerp is a function for finding a spot part way between two vectors. When combined with a tick function or loop, we can use it to smoothly animate something moving between two points.

```lua
local propCubeTemplate = script:GetCustomProperty("CubeTemplate")
local myObject = World.SpawnAsset(propCubeTemplate)

local startPosition = Vector3.New(500, -500, 500)
local endPosition = Vector3.New(500, 500, 500)

myObject:SetWorldPosition(startPosition)

-- Note: You generally would not want to call SetWorldPosition except in a client context. (Otherwise,
-- it would "jitter" due to network lag.)  If you want to do this kind of effect for objects on the server,
-- consider using CoreObject:MoveTo() and similar functions!
for i = 1, 30 do
    myObject:SetWorldPosition(Vector3.Lerp(startPosition, endPosition, i/300))
    ut.EXPECT_VEC_EQUAL(Vector3.Lerp(startPosition, endPosition, i/300), (endPosition - startPosition) * i / 300 + startPosition, "LERP should equal our hand-calculated value")
    Task.Wait()
end

print("Tah dah!")
```

### Vector3.New

There are several different ways to create Vector3s. You can directly specify the x, y, z coordinates, or you can feed it a Vector2 or Vector4 to pull coordinates from, or you can just give it a single number to apply to x y and z.

```lua
-- Makes a vector3 where x=1, y=2, z=3:
local myVector3_0 = Vector3.New(1, 2, 3)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(myVector3_0, vec3_123, "Basic constructor")

-- Another way of making a vector3 where x=1, y=2, z=3:
local myVec2 = Vector2.New(1, 2)
local myVector3_1 = Vector3.New(myVec2, 3)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(myVector3_1, vec3_123, "Vec2 constructor")

-- Yet another way of making a vector3 where x=1, y=2, z=3:
local myVec4 = Vector4.New(1, 2, 3, 4)
local myVector3_2 = Vector3.New(myVec4)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(myVector3_2, vec3_123, "Vec4 constructor")

-- Makes a vector3 where x=6, y=6, z=6:
local myVector3_3 = Vector3.New(6)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(myVector3_3, vec3_6, "Single-argument constructor")

-- We can also make new Vector3s based on existing ones:
local copyOfVector3_3 = Vector3.New(myVector3_3)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(copyOfVector3_3, vec3_6, "Copy constructor")
```

### Vector3.ZERO

### Vector3.ONE

### Vector3.FORWARD

### Vector3.UP

### Vector3.RIGHT

The Vector3 namespace includes a small selection of constants, for commonly-used Vector3 values.

```lua
print(Vector3.ZERO)    -- (0, 0, 0)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(Vector3.ZERO, Vector3.New(0), "Vector3.ZERO")

print(Vector3.ONE)    -- (1, 1, 1)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(Vector3.ONE, Vector3.New(1), "Vector3.ONE")

print(Vector3.FORWARD)    -- (1, 0, 0)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(Vector3.FORWARD, Vector3.New(1, 0, 0), "Vector3.FORWARD")

print(Vector3.RIGHT)    -- (0, 1, 0)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(Vector3.RIGHT, Vector3.New(0, 1, 0), "Vector3.RIGHT")

print(Vector3.UP)    -- (0, 0, 1)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(Vector3.UP, Vector3.New(0, 0, 1), "Vector3.UP")
```

### Vector3+Vector3

### Vector3+Number

### Vector3-Vector3

### Vector3-Number

### Vector3*Vector3

### Vector3*Number

### Number*Vector3

### Vector3/Vector3

### Vector3/Number

### -Vector3

Most arithmetic operators will work on Vector3s in straightforward ways.

```lua
local a = Vector3.New(1, 2, 3)
local b = Vector3.New(4, 5, 6)

-- Adding and subtracting vectors is the same as adding or subtracting each of their components.
print(a + b) -- (5, 7, 9)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(a + b, Vector3.New(5, 7, 9), "Vector addition")
print(b - a) -- (3, 3, 3)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(b - a, Vector3.New(3), "Vector subtraction")

-- You can also add or subtract a number and a vector - it will just add or subtract that
-- number from each component.
print(a + 2) -- 3, 4, 5
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(a + 2, Vector3.New(3, 4, 5), "Vector addition to a number")

print(b - 2) -- 2, 3, 4
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(b - 2, Vector3.New(2, 3, 4), "vector minus a number")

-- Multiplication and Division work the same way:
print (a * b) -- 4, 10, 18
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(a * b, Vector3.New(4, 10, 18), "Vector multiplication")
print (a * 2) -- 2, 4, 6
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(a * 2, Vector3.New(2, 4, 6), "Vector number multiplication")
print (2 * a) -- 2, 4, 6
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(2 * a, Vector3.New(2, 4, 6), "number vector multiplication")

print(a / b) -- (0.25, 0.4, 0.3)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(a / b, Vector3.New(1/4, 2/5, 3/6), "Vector division")
print(b / 4) -- (1, 1.25, 1.5)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(b / 4, Vector3.New(1, 1.25, 1.5), "Vector number division")

-- You can also just negate a vector:

print(-a) -- -1, -2, -3
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(-a, Vector3.New(-1, -2, -3), "vector negation")
```

### Vector3.GetNormalized()

### Vector3..Vector3

### Vector3^Vector3

A normalized vector is a vector who's magnitude (size) is equal to 1. Vector3 variables have a `GetNormalized()` function, which returns this value. Its equivalent to dividing the vector by its own size, and is useful in linear algebra.

Dot Product and Cross Product are two other common linear algebra operations, which can be represented in Lua byh the `..` and `^` operators respectively.

Here is a sample that uses these operations to determine if an object is aimed within 15 degrees of a player.

```lua
local propCubeTemplate = script:GetCustomProperty("CubeTemplate")
local myObject = World.SpawnAsset(propCubeTemplate, {
        position = Vector3.New(500, 0, 250)
    })

myObject:RotateContinuous(Rotation.New(0, 0, 40))

for i = 1, 10, 0.05 do
    local playerPos = player:GetWorldPosition()
    local objectPos = myObject:GetWorldPosition()
    local objectAim = myObject:GetWorldTransform():GetForwardVector()
    local objToPlayer = (playerPos - objectPos):GetNormalized()

    -- draw a line so we can see where it is "looking"
    CoreDebug.DrawLine(objectPos, objectPos + objectAim * 1000,
        {
            duration = 0.05,
            thickness = 5,
            color = Color.RED
        })

    -- Is the object facing the player?  (And not 180 degrees the opposite direction?)
    -- When the vectors are normalized, (which these are), the dot product is equal to
    -- the cosine of the angle between the vectors. Which means it will be positive,
    -- if the two vectors aren't more than 90 degrees apart. This makes it a great way to check
    -- if something is "generally facing" something else!
    if (objToPlayer .. objectAim > 0) then
        -- Here we check if the player is actually within 15 degrees of the aim.
        -- we can do this, because if the input vectors are normalized (which again, these are),
        -- then the output vector has a magnitude equal to the sin of the angle between them.
        -- So this makes it a really easy way to check if a vector is within a certain angle
        -- of another vector. (Especially if we combine it with the previous check to make sure
        -- they're facing the same direction!)
        if (objToPlayer ^ objectAim).size < math.sin(15) then
            print("I see you!")
        end
    end
    Task.Wait(0.05)
    break --UT_STRIP
end
```

### Vector3.size

### Vector3.sizeSquared

A lot of vector math requires knowing the magnitude of a vector - i. e. if you think of the vector as a point, how far away is it from (0, 0, 0)?

In Lua, you can get that value via the `size` property. There is also the `sizeSquared` property, which is sometimes useful as a CPU optimization. Typically `sizeSquared` is used instead of `size` in distance comparisons, because if `a.size < b.size`, then `a.sizeSquared < b.sizeSquared`.

This sample creates a healing aura around an object, that heals the player more, the closer they are to it.

```lua
local propCubeTemplate = script:GetCustomProperty("CubeTemplate")
local healNode = World.SpawnAsset(propCubeTemplate, {
            position = Vector3.New(500, 0, 0)
        })

local healRadius = 1000

-- The heal node will pulse 50 times, 5 times per second:
for i = 1, 50 do
    for k, player in pairs(Game.GetPlayers()) do
        local p = player:GetWorldPosition()
        local n = healNode:GetWorldPosition()
        local distanceSquared = (p - n).sizeSquared
        if distanceSquared < healRadius * healRadius then
            local distance = (p - n).size
            -- Apply a negative damage to heal the player:
            local healAmount = 5 * (1 - distance / healRadius)
            player:ApplyDamage(Damage.New(-healAmount))
            print("Player is being healed for " .. tostring(healAmount))

            ut.EXPECT_NEARLY_EQUAL(healAmount, 2.4482, "Heal amount should be about right", 0.1)
            ut.EXPECT_NEARLY_EQUAL(distance, math.sqrt(distanceSquared), "distance squared", 0.1)
        end
    end
    break --UT_STRIP
    Task.Wait(0.2)
end
```

### Vector3.x

### Vector3.y

### Vector3.z

After creating a `Vector3`, we can read or write to its x, y, z components directly.

```lua
local myVector3 = Vector3.New(1, 2, 3)

print(myVector3.x) -- 1
print(myVector3.y) -- 2
print(myVector3.z) -- 3
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(myVector3.x, 1)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(myVector3.y, 2)
ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(myVector3.z, 3)

-- We can also modify them directly, to create a new vector:
myVector3.x = 4
myVector3.y = 5
myVector3.z = 6

print(myVector3)
-- myVector3 now equals (4, 5, 6)
```
