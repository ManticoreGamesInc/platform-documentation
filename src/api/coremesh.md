CoreMesh

## Description

CoreMesh is a CoreObject representing a mesh that can be placed in the scene. It is the parent type for both AnimatedMesh and StaticMesh.

## API

### Properties 

| Property Name | Return Type | Description | Tags |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `team` | `Integer` | Assigns the mesh to a team. Value range from `0` to `4`. `0` is neutral team. | Read-Write |
| `isTeamColorUsed` | `bool` | If `true`, and the mesh has been assigned to a valid team, players on that team will see a blue mesh, while other players will see red. Requires a material that supports the color property. | Read-Write |
| `isTeamCollisionEnabled` | `bool` | If `false`, and the mesh has been assigned to a valid team, players on that team will not collide with the mesh. | Read-Write |
| `isEnemyCollisionEnabled` | `bool` | If `false`, and the mesh has been assigned to a valid team, players on other teams will not collide with the mesh. | Read-Write |
| `isCameraCollisionEnabled` | `bool` | If `false`, the mesh will not push against the camera. Useful for things like railings or transparent walls. | Read-Write |
| `meshAssetId` | `string` | The ID of the mesh asset used by this mesh. | Read-Only |

### Functions 

| Function Name | Return Type | Description | Tags |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `GetColor()` | `Color` | Returns the color override previously set from script, or `0, 0, 0, 0` if no such color has been set. | None |
| `SetColor(Color)` | `None` | Overrides the color of all materials on the mesh, and replicates the new colors. | None |
| `ResetColor()` | `None` | Turns off the color override, if there is one. | None |

## Examples 

### CoreMesh.GetColor

### CoreMesh.SetColor

### CoreMesh.ResetColor

You can set a color override for a mesh. Exactly what this means will depend on the material of the mesh, but in general, setting a mesh's color will make the mesh be tinted to match that color.

```lua
    local cube = World.SpawnAsset(propCubeTemplate, {position = Vector3.New(1000, 0, 300) })

    cube:SetColor(Color.WHITE)
    for i = 1, 40 do
        local cubeColor = cube:GetColor()
        local newColor = Color.New(cubeColor.r * 0.95, cubeColor.g * 0.95, cubeColor.b * 0.95)
        cube:SetColor(newColor)
        Task.Wait(0.025)
    end
    ut.EXPECT_COL_EQUAL(Color.New(0.128512, 0.128512, 0.128512), cube:GetColor(), "Cube colors")
    cube:ResetColor()
    ut.EXPECT_COL_EQUAL(Color.New(0, 0, 0, 0), cube:GetColor(), "Cube colors after reset")
```

### CoreMesh.meshAssetId

You can check the asset ID of a static mesh. This will be the MUID of the Core Content object it was created from!

```lua
    local cube = World.SpawnAsset(propCubeTemplate, {position = Vector3.New(1000, 0, 300) })
    print("The asset ID is " .. cube.meshAssetId)
    ut.EXPECT_EQUAL(cube.meshAssetId, "A7DD0A093F1FA6B6:Cube", "meshAssetId")
```

### CoreMesh.team

### CoreMesh.isTeamColorUsed

### CoreMesh.isTeamCollisionEnabled

### CoreMesh.isEnemyCollisionEnabled

### CoreMesh.isCameraCollisionEnabled

You can set a mesh to belong to a particular "team". These match the teams that players can be set to. (0-4)  There are also several properties that are keyed to what team an object is on.

This sample sets a mesh (and all of its children) to be on a particular team.

You can also control whether the camera is allowed to clip into a mesh or not.

```lua
    function AssignMeshToTeam(mesh, team)
        local objects = mesh:FindDescendantsByType("CoreMesh")
        table.insert(objects, mesh)
        for k, mesh in ipairs(objects) do
            -- Set the team
            mesh.team = team
            -- Make the mesh tinted based on the color of the team it is on.
            mesh.isTeamColorUsed = true
            -- Enable collision for enemies, but not allies.
            mesh.isTeamCollisionEnabled = false
            mesh.isEnemyCollisionEnabled = true
            -- Set the camera to not collide with this mesh.
            mesh.isCameraCollisionEnabled = true
        end
    end
    AssignMeshToTeam(cube, 1)
```
