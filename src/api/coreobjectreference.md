# API: CoreObjectReference

## Description

A reference to a CoreObject which may or may not exist. This type is returned by `CoreObject:GetCustomProperty()` for CoreObjectReference properties, and may be used to find the actual object if it exists.

In the case of networked objects it's possible to get a CoreObjectReference pointing to a CoreObject that hasn't been received on the client yet.

## API

### Properties

| Property Name | Return Type | Description | Tags |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `id` | `string` | The MUID of the referred object. | Read-Only |
| `isAssigned` | `bool` | Returns true if this reference has been assigned a valid ID. This does not necessarily mean the object currently exists. | Read-Only |

### Functions

| Function Name | Return Type | Description | Tags |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `GetObject()` | `CoreObject` | Returns the CoreObject with a matching ID, if it exists. Will otherwise return nil. | None |
| `WaitForObject([Number])` | `CoreObject` | Returns the CoreObject with a matching ID, if it exists. If it does not, yields the current task until the object is spawned. Optional timeout parameter will cause the task to resume with a return value of false and an error message if the object has not been spawned within that many seconds. | None |

## Examples

- `GetObject`

- `WaitForObject`

- `id`

- `isAssigned`

Sometimes you need to pass around a reference to a core object, instead of the actual object itself. This is most common when accessing custom properties - any core objects you have attached as custom properties are stored as `CoreObjectReferences`.

A `CoreObjectReference` is basically just a placeholder that you can use to access the original object. Except unlike the original object, the `CoreObjectReference` is small and light, and can be passed around via Networked Custom Properties and Events.

This sample assumes that the script has a custom property of type `CoreObjectReference`, which refers to the default floor in the scene.

```lua
-- The autogenerated code to access the custom property looks like this:
local propDefaultFloor = script:GetCustomProperty("DefaultFloor"):WaitForObject()
-- Since you usually don't care about the reference itself, and just want to
-- access the object, it normally appends WaitForObject(), to return the object
-- after waiting for it to load.

local floorObjectReference = script:GetCustomProperty("DefaultFloor")

-- If we didn't care about the object (possibly) not being loaded yet, we could
-- also just get the object directly:

local propDefaultFloor_noWaiting = floorObjectReference:GetObject()

-- We can also check things on the reference directly, such as if it has been
-- assigned to an object, and the MUID of the object it references:
if floorObjectReference.isAssigned then
    print("The MUD is: " .. floorObjectReference.id)
end
```
