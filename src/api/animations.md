### Animation

General Ability Animation Information

All Ability animations are valid on any of the available body types.
Each of the Ability animations timing and/or translation values should behave identically across the body types.
All Ability animations have a long "tail" that gracefully transitions the character back to idle pose. This animation tail is intended to only be seen if the Player does not execute any other Ability or movement. In nearly all practical use cases, the Ability animation tails will be interrupted to do other game mechanics.

!!! Note
    If the intent is to have an Ability "execute" as quickly as possible after the button press, it is still generally a good idea to have a very small cast phase value (0.1 second or so). This will help with minor server/client latency issues and will also help to ensure smoother playback of character animations.

#### Socket Names
