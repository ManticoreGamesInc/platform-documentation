# Player Animations & Sockets

## Overview

Core has built-in animations and stances that can be applied to the player's character and animated meshes. Importing animations is not supported, but custom animations can be created for the player's character by using [IK Anchors](../api/ikanchor.md).

A player's character and animated mesh can have an animation stance, which are states of movement that the mesh will continue until a new animation stance is set. They can also can have an animation that are intended to be used once (but can be looped), and then let the mesh return to the animation state (stance).

## Player Animations and Animation Stances

Players can be animated using the two types of animations here, as well as through custom animations created using [IK Anchors](../api/ikanchor.md). The **Animation Stance** animations can be applied to players and used continuously while players are moving, and the **Animation** category must be associated with an [**Ability**](../api/ability.md) and activated that way.

## Animated Mesh Animations and Animation Stances

**AnimatedMesh** objects use a different set of animations from players which vary based on the type of AnimatedMesh. See the [AnimatedMesh Reference](../api/animatedmesh.md) for more information.

## The Design of Animations in Core

In Core, all ability animations are valid on any of the available body types. Each of the ability animations timing and/or translation values should behave identically across the body types.

All ability animations have a long "tail" that gracefully transitions the character back to idle pose. This animation tail is intended to only be seen if the player does not execute any other ability or movement. In nearly all practical use cases, the ability animation tails will be interrupted to do other game mechanics.

!!! note
    If the intent is to have an ability "execute" as quickly as possible after the button press, it is still generally a good idea to have a very small cast phase value (0.1 second or so). This will help with minor server/client latency issues and will also help to ensure smoother playback of character animations.

## Sockets

Sockets are different points on an animated and player's character mesh. They can be used for attaching objects, and controlling a ragdoll effect for the player's character.

| unarmed_stance                      | This is a set of animations that will cause the character to walk or stand with nothing being held in their hands. This set of animations includes runing/strafing, walking, jumping, and idling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | player               |                             |
| unarmed_bind_pose                   | This is a single frame animation of what the character looks like in default pose. This is useful for determining default socket locations/distances and rotations. This can be very useful to register geometry when building "costumes" for characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | player, animatedMesh |                             |
| unarmed_crouch_idle_relaxed         | An idle where the character is on one knee, low to the ground for Animated Mesh Humanoids. For Players, crouches are handled as a mechanic which is determined by the Player Settings Object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | animatedMesh         |                             |
| unarmed_crouch_run_forward          | A stooping run animation that is low to the ground for Animated Mesh Humanoids. For Players, crouches are handled as a mechanic which is determined by the Player Settings Object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | animatedMesh         |                             |
| unarmed_browse_virtual_interface    | A looping animation that features the player looking at a virtual interface and swiping down at 1 second and swiping right at 4 seconds. There are lua animation events for these moments which return the string "action." There is also a corresponding vfx asset in the core catalog which has swiping behavior which can be used with this animation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | player               |                             |
| unarmed_carry_object_heavy          | A one (right) handed carry animation with the arm at waist height. Ideal for holding a mug, potion, etc. When running/jumping, the right arm will retain the lifted arm pose. The left arm will inherit the animation underneath. This animation assumes the prop is attached to the right_prop socket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | player               |                             |
| unarmed_carry_object_high           | A one (right) handed carry animation with the arm raised to roughly eye level. Ideal for holding a torch up to see better, etc. When running/jumping, the right arm will retain the lifted arm pose. The left arm will inherit the animation underneath. This animation assumes the prop is attached to the right_prop socket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | player               |                             |
| unarmed_carry_object_low            | A one (right) handed carry animation with the arm at waist height. Ideal for holding a mug, potion, etc. When running/jumping, the right arm will retain the lifted arm pose. The left arm will inherit the animation underneath. This animation assumes the prop is attached to the right_prop socket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | player               |                             |
| unarmed_carry_score_card            | A two handed carry animation with the arms all the way extended above the head. Ideal for holding text signs, etc. When running/jumping etc., the entire upper body will retain this pose. The attachment point for the card is the right prop, and it registers to the center of the bottom edge of the card/sign. It also assumes x forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | player               |                             |

| unarmed_sit_chair_upright           | A pose that will transition to a (looping) sitting position assuming a chair. For best results, create a "registration point" for the player by positioning and orienting the player so that they are facing directly away from the chair geometry, and in front of it (roughly 60 units from the direct center of the seat surface.) The seat surface should be around 0.5 meters higher than the player registration point. Collisions will likely have to be turned off on at least some of the chair geometry to align the player with the chair very closely. For Animated Mesh Humanoid Rigs, this sitting animation is a PlayAnimation. Please refer to that section on this page. | player               |                             |
| unarmed_sit_ground_crossed          | An animation that will transition to a (looping) sitting position on the ground. The character will maintain their general position as they sit.
