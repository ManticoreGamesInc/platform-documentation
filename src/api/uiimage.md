# UIImage

A UIControl for displaying an image.

## Properties

| Property Name | Return Type | Description | Tags |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `isTeamColorUsed` | `boolean` | If `true`, the image will be tinted blue if its team matches the Player, or red if not. | Read-Write |
| `team` | `integer` | the team of the image, used for `isTeamColorUsed`. | Read-Write |
| `shouldClipToSize` | `boolean` | Whether or not the image and its shadow should be clipped when exceeding the bounds of this control. | Read-Write |
| `isFlippedHorizontal` | `boolean` | Whether or not the image is flipped horizontally. | Read-Write |
| `isFlippedVertical` | `boolean` | Whether or not the image is flipped vertically. | Read-Write |

## Functions

| Function Name | Return Type | Description | Tags |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `GetColor()` | [`Color`](color.md) | Returns the current color of the UIImage. | None |
| `SetColor(Color)` | `None` | Sets the UIImage to a color. | None |
| `GetShadowColor()` | [`Color`](color.md) | Returns the color of the image's drop shadow. | None |
| `SetShadowColor(Color)` | `None` | Sets the color of the image's drop shadow. | None |
| `GetShadowOffset()` | [`Vector2`](vector2.md) | Returns the offset of the image's drop shadow in UI space. | None |
| `SetShadowOffset(Vector2)` | `None` | Sets the offset of the image's drop shadow in UI space. | None |
| `GetImage()` | `string` | Returns the `imageId` assigned to this UIImage control. **Note:** As of 1.0.211, this function returns `nil` instead of `"0BADBADBADBADBAD"` when no image asset has been set. | **Breaking-Change** |
| `SetImage(string imageId)` | `None` | Sets the UIImage to a new image asset ID. You can get this ID from an Asset Reference. | None |
| `SetImage(Player)` | `None` | Downloads and sets a Player's profile picture as the texture for this UIImage control. | **Deprecated** |
| `SetPlayerProfile(Player)` | `None` | Downloads and sets a Player's profile picture as the texture for this UIImage control. | None |
| `SetPlayerProfile(CorePlayerProfile)` | `None` | Downloads and sets a player's profile picture as the texture for this UIImage control. | None |
| `SetPlayerProfile(CoreFriendCollectionEntry)` | `None` | Downloads and sets a player's profile picture as the texture for this UIImage control. | None |
| `SetPlayerProfile(string playerId)` | `None` | Downloads and sets a player's profile picture as the texture for this UIImage control. | None |
| `SetGameScreenshot(string gameId, [integer screenshotIndex])` | `None` | Downloads and sets a game screenshot as the texture for this UIImage control. The screenshot may come from a different game. | None |
| `SetCameraCapture(CameraCapture)` | `None` | Sets the UIImage to display the given camera capture. If the given capture is not valid, it will be ignored. If the capture is released while in use, this UIImage will revert to its default image. | Client-Only |

## Examples

Example using:

### `SetGameScreenshot`

Similar to portals, it's possible to show screenshots from another game inside 2D UI. In this example, we have a UI Image added as a custom property of the script. The script asks Core for the list of featured games and scrolls through all the screenshots for those games. In the end, the image is cleared back to normal.

```lua
local IMAGE = script:GetCustomProperty("UIImage"):WaitForObject()

local featuredGames = CorePlatform.GetGameCollection("featured")

for _,entry in ipairs(featuredGames) do
    print("Showing screenshots for " .. entry.name)
    
    local gameInfo = CorePlatform.GetGameInfo(entry.id)
    local count = gameInfo.screenshotCount
    
    -- Show each of the game's screenshots
    for i = 1,count do
        IMAGE:SetGameScreenshot(entry.id, i)
        Task.Wait(1)
    end
end

-- Clear it
IMAGE:SetGameScreenshot("")
```

Example using:

### `SetPlayerProfile`

Player icons are a staple among online games. Player icons allow players to identify themselves within a game. This example will show you how to display your Core profile picture in a UI Image object.

```lua
-- Get the UI Image object
local propUIImage = script:GetCustomProperty("UIImage"):WaitForObject()

-- Get the local player
local player = Game.GetLocalPlayer()

-- Replaces the UI Image with your Core profile picture
propUIImage:SetPlayerProfile(player)
```

Example using:

### `SetPlayerProfile`

Often to identify players you will want to use their Core profile picture. This example will demonstrate how to display the Core profile pictures of your friends by using the `SetPlayerProfile` method of a UI Image.

```lua
-- Get the local player
local player = Game.GetLocalPlayer()

-- Get the UI Image object
local propUIImage = script:GetCustomProperty("UIImage"):WaitForObject()

-- Get an array of friends of the local player
local friends = CoreSocial.GetFriends(player):GetResults()

-- Stores the current index in the friend list that is being used (starts at 1)
local currentIndex = 1

-- Represents the number of seconds left until the UI Image is updated with the profile picture of the next friend
local timer = 0

function Tick(deltaTime)
    -- Decrement the "deltaTime" number of seconds from the "timer"
    timer = timer - deltaTime

    -- If 2 seconds have passed, show the profile picture of the next friend, and reset the "timer" to 2 seconds
    if(timer <= 0) then
        -- If you have no friends on your Core friend list, then the rest of the code will be skipped
        -- Doing this prevents the script from trying to read an empty Core friend list.
        if(#friends == 0) then
            -- Exit this function before updating UI Image
            return
        end

        -- Reset the "timer" to 2 seconds
        timer = 2

        -- Get the id of the friend at the current index of the array 
        local friend_id = friends[currentIndex].id

        -- Update the image with the friend's profile picture
        propUIImage:SetPlayerProfile(friend_id)

        -- Increment the "currentIndex" to select the next friend from the list
        currentIndex = currentIndex + 1

        -- If the "currentIndex" has reached the end of the list, reset it back to the start of the friend list
        if(currentIndex > #friends) then
            currentIndex = 1
        end
    end
end
```

Example using:

### `SetShadowOffset`

### `SetShadowColor`

Shadows provide a great way to make your UI Image stand out. This example will show you how to change the position and color of the shadow of a UI Image by using the `SetShadowOffset` and `SetShadowColor` methods.

```lua
-- Get the UI Image object
local propUIImage = script:GetCustomProperty("UIImage"):WaitForObject()

-- Keep track of the number of seconds that have passed since the script began running
local timePassed = 0

-- The relative position of the center of the circle
local circleCenterPosition = Vector2.New(30, 30)

function Tick(deltaTime)
    -- Update the "timePassed" to keep track of the number of seconds that have passed
    timePassed = timePassed + deltaTime

    -- Store the x and y position of the shadow
    local offset = Vector2.New(0, 0)

    -- Calculate the x and y position based on the time that has passed
    offset.x = (math.sin(timePassed) * 20) + circleCenterPosition.x
    offset.y = (math.cos(timePassed) * 20) + circleCenterPosition.y

    -- Update the position of the shadow
    propUIImage:SetShadowOffset(offset)

    -- The color will be stored in this variable
    local shadowColor = Color.New(0, 0, 1)

    -- Calculate the amount of blue that the shadow color will have
    local BlueChannel = (math.sin(timePassed) * 0.5) + 0.5

    -- Update the amount of blue the color "shadowColor" should have
    shadowColor.b = BlueChannel

    -- Update the color of the shadow of the UI Image
    propUIImage:SetShadowColor(shadowColor)
end
```
