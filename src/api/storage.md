# Storage

The Storage namespace contains a set of functions for handling persistent storage of data. To use the Storage API, you must place a Game Settings object in your game and check the Enable Player Storage property on it.

Core storage allows a maximum of 16Kb (16384 bytes) of encoded data to be stored. Any data exceeding this limit is not guaranteed to be stored and can potentially cause loss of stored data. Exceeding the limit will cause a warning to be displayed in the event log when in preview mode.

`Storage.SizeOfData()` can be used to check the size of data (in bytes) before assigning to storage. If size limit has been exceeded consider replacing strings with numbers or using advanced techniques such as bit packing to reduce the size of data stored.

## Class Functions

| Class Function Name | Return Type | Description | Tags |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `Storage.GetPlayerData(Player player)` | `table` | Returns the player data associated with `player`. This returns a copy of the data that has already been retrieved for the player, so calling this function does not incur any additional network cost. Changes to the data in the returned table will not be persisted without calling `Storage.SetPlayerData()`. | Server-Only |
| `Storage.SetPlayerData(Player player, table data)` | <[`StorageResultCode`](enums.md#storageresultcode) string`>` | Updates the data associated with `player`. Returns a result code and an error message. See below for supported data types. | Server-Only |
| `Storage.GetSharedPlayerData(NetReference sharedStorageKey, Player player)` | `table` | Returns the shared player data associated with `player` and `sharedStorageKey`. This returns a copy of the data that has already been retrieved for the player, so calling this function does not incur any additional network cost. Changes to the data in the returned table will not be persisted without calling `Storage.SetSharedPlayerData()`. | Server-Only |
| `Storage.SetSharedPlayerData(NetReference sharedStorageKey, Player player, table data)` | <[`StorageResultCode`](enums.md#storageresultcode) string`>` | Updates the shared data associated with `player` and `sharedStorageKey`. Returns a result code and an error message. See below for supported data types. | Server-Only |
| `Storage.SizeOfData(table data)` | `integer` | Computes and returns the size required for the given `data` table when stored as Player data. | Server-Only |

## Examples

Example using:

### `GetPlayerData`

This example detects when a player joins the game and fetches their XP and level from storage. Those properties are moved to the player's resources for use by other gameplay systems.

```lua
function OnPlayerJoined(player)
    local data = Storage.GetPlayerData(player)
    -- In case it's the first time for this player we use default values 0 and 1
    local xp = data["xp"] or 0
    local level = data["level"] or 1
    -- Each time they join they gain 1 XP. Stop and play the game again to test that this value keeps going up
    xp = xp + 1
    player:SetResource("xp", xp)
    player:SetResource("level", level)
    print("Player " .. player.name .. " joined with Level " .. level .. " and XP " .. xp)
end

Game.playerJoinedEvent:Connect(OnPlayerJoined)
```

Example using:

### `GetSharedPlayerData`

This example shows how to read data that has been saved to Shared Storage. Because this is saved via shared-key persistence, the data may have been written by a different game. This allows you to have multiple games share the same set of player data.

For this example to work, there is some setup that needs to be done:

- Storage needs to be enabled in the Game Settings object.

- You have to create a shared key.

- The NetReference for the shared key needs to be added to the script as a custom property.

See the <a href="https://docs.coregames.com/tutorials/shared_storage/">Shared Storage</a> documentation for details on how to create shared keys.

```lua
local propSharedKey = script:GetCustomProperty("DocTestSharedKey")
local returnTable = Storage.GetSharedPlayerData(propSharedKey, player)

-- Print out the data we retrieved:
for k, v in pairs(returnTable) do
    print(k, v)
end
```

Example using:

### `SetPlayerData`

This example detects when a player gains XP or level and saves the new values to storage.

```lua
function OnResourceChanged(player, resName, resValue)
    if (resName == "xp" or resName == "level") then
        local data = Storage.GetPlayerData(player)
        data[resName] = resValue
        local resultCode,errorMessage = Storage.SetPlayerData(player, data)
    end
end

function OnPlayerJoined(player)
    player.resourceChangedEvent:Connect(OnResourceChanged)
end

Game.playerJoinedEvent:Connect(OnPlayerJoined)
```

Example using:

### `SetSharedPlayerData`

This example shows how to write data to the Shared Storage. With this, any maps that you enable with your shared key can all access the same data that is associated with a player. This means that you could have several games where reward, levels, or achievements carry over between them.

For this example to work, there is some setup th at needs to be done:

- Storage needs to be enabled in the Game Settings object.

- You have to create a shared key.

- The NetReference for the shared key needs to be added to the script as a custom property.

See the <a href="https://docs.coregames.com/tutorials/shared_storage/">Shared Storage</a> documentation for details on how to create shared keys.

```lua
local propSharedKey = script:GetCustomProperty("DocTestSharedKey")

local sampleData = {
    name = "Philip",
    points = 1000,
    favorite_color = Color.RED,
    skill_levels = {swordplay = 8, flying = 10, electromagnetism = 5, friendship = 30}
}
Storage.SetSharedPlayerData(propSharedKey, player, sampleData)
```
