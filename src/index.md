# Core Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Core Editor, the all-in-one metaverse platform that allows you to create online worlds, special interactive chatrooms, live parties, concerts, expos, or pretty much anything else you can imagine.

## Core Features
<!-- vale Google.Acronyms = NO -->
- **One-click publishing**: Launch and share an experience with the push of a button.
- **Persistent cross-world identities**: Players can enter the experiences you build with their own customized avatars, mounts, and emotes.
- **Community collaboration**: Bolster your creation with objects, scripts, and games shared by other Core Creators.
- **AAA-quality development tools**: VFX, audio, materials, textures, skyboxes, terrain sculpting, heightmaps, scripting, and an expansive list of features in the works, all powered by Unreal Engine.
- **Web3 integration**: Create immersive multiplayer content based on NFT collections, smart contract metadata, and the connected wallets of your community members.

*[AAA]: In the video-game industry, AAA (pronounced and sometimes written triple-A) is an informal classification used to categorise games produced and distributed by a mid-sized or major publisher, which typically have higher development and marketing budgets than other tiers of games.
*[NFT]: A non-fungible token (NFT) is a financial security consisting of digital data stored in a blockchain, a form of distributed ledger.
