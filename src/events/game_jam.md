Join the Devs in the first ever CORE Alpha Game Jam!

The Manticore team is hard at work cranking out games and assets in our first internal CORE Game Jam. We want to invite all CORE Alpha Creators to Jam along with us!

### Theme: Welcome Jam
To join in: create and share anything that helps the next wave of CORE Alpha Creators create and learn faster!  This can be a helpful script, a customizable environment, a super useful prop, or even a full game.

### How to Enter
Submit any game or community content by **Sunday, Dec 22, 23:59 PST**. Tag your submission with `welcomejam` when publishing your content to be considered.

### Prizes

We will be featuring ALL Welcome Jam submissions on ManticoreTV on Monday, December 23 at 13:00 PST, including things made by the Manticore team!

Three creators will win official CORE hoodies, the same ones the Manticore team received to commemorate Alpha Launch. The Manticore team will choose three submissions based on:
- The Most Helpful
- The Most Creative
- The Most Fun
