# Lua Scripting API

## Overview

Core scripts are written in Lua, using version 5.3.4 of the [Lua library](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/). Scripts are objects created and added to the hierarchy and/or templates, similar to other object types. Scripts added to the hierarchy will execute as soon as the game loads, while scripts inside templates execute with each newly spawned instance of the template.

Properties, functions, and events inherited by [CoreObject](#coreobject) types are listed below. Both properties and events are accessed with `.propertyName` and `.eventName`, while functions are accessed with `:FunctionName()`. Some types have class functions, which are accessed with `.FunctionName()`.

## Core Lua Types

At a high level, Core Lua types can be divided into two groups: Data structures and Objects. Data structures are owned by Lua, while Objects are owned by the engine and could be destroyed while still referenced by Lua. Objects all inherit from a single base type: Object. Data structures have no common parent. However, all data structures and Objects share a common `type` property, which is a string indicating its type. The value of the `type` property will match the section headings below, for example: "Ability", "Vector2", "CoreObject", etc. All Core types also share an `IsA()` function. The `IsA()` function can be passed a type name, and will return `true` if the value is that type or one of its subtypes, or will return `false` if it is not. For example, `myObject:IsA("StaticMesh")`.

A lowercase type denotes a basic Lua type, such as `string` and `boolean`. You can learn more about Lua types from the official manual [here](https://www.lua.org/manual/2.2/section3_3.html). An uppercase type is a Core Type, such as `Player` and `CoreObject`.

### Ability

Abilities are CoreObjects that can be added to Players and guide the Player's animation in sync with the Ability's state machine. Spawn an Ability with `World.SpawnAsset()` or add an Ability as a child of an Equipment/Weapon to have it be assigned to the Player automatically when that item is equipped.

Abilities can be activated by association with an Action Binding. Their internal state machine flows through the phases: Ready, Cast, Execute, Recovery and Cooldown. An Ability begins in the Ready state and transitions to Cast when its Binding (e.g. Left mouse click) is activated by the owning player. It then automatically flows from Cast to Execute, then Recovery and finally Cooldown. At each of these state transitions it fires a corresponding event.

Only one ability can be active at a time. By default, activating an ability will interrupt the currently active ability. The canBePrevented and preventsOtherAbilities properties can be used to customize interruption rules for competing abilities.

If an ability is interrupted during the Cast phase, it will immediately reset to the Ready state. If an ability is interrupted during the Execute or Recovery phase, the ability will immediately transition to the Cooldown phase.

### Camera

Camera is a CoreObject which is used both to configure Player Camera settings as well as to represent the position and rotation of the Camera in the world. Cameras can be configured in various ways, usually following a specific Player's view, but can also have a fixed orientation and/or position.

Each Player (on their client) can have a default Camera and an override Camera. If they have neither, camera behavior falls back to a basic third-person behavior. Default Cameras should be used for main gameplay while override Cameras are generally employed as a temporary view, such as a when the Player is sitting in a mounted turret.

## Core Lua Namespaces

Some sets of related functionality are grouped within namespaces, which are similar to the types above, but cannot be instantiated. They are only ever accessed by calling functions within these namespaces.

### Core Lua Functions

A few base functions provided by the platform.

| Function | Return Type | Description | Tags |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `Tick(Number deltaTime)` | Number | Tick event, used for things you need to check continuously (e.g. main game loop), but be careful of putting too much logic here or you will cause performance issues. DeltaTime is the time difference (in seconds) between this and the last tick. | None |
| `time()` | Number | Returns the time in seconds (floating point) since the game started on the server. | None |
| `print(string)` | string | Print a message to the event log. Access the Event Log from the "View" menu. | None |

Multiple tasks can be included in the trace is one task triggers an event that has listeners registered, or if a task calls `require()` to load a new script. | None |

### CoreMath

Defaults to `false`.<br/>`maxResults (integer)`: Limits the number of strings that will be returned. The last result will be any remaining unsplit portion of `s`.<br/>`delimiters (string or Array<string>)`:Allows splitting on multiple delimiters. If both this and the `delimiter` parameter are specified, the combined list is used. If neither is specified, default is to split on any whitespace characters.<br/>Note that this function does not return a table, it returns multiple strings. For example: `local myHello, myCore = CoreString.Split("Hello Core!")` If a table is desired, wrap the call to `Split()` in curly braces, eg: `local myTable = {CoreString.Split("Hello Core!")}` | None |
| `CoreString.Trim(string s, [...])` | string | Trims whitespace from the start and end of `s`, returning the result.

### Built-In Lua Functions

For security reasons, various built-in Lua functions have been restricted or removed entirely. The available functions are listed below. Note that Lua's built-in trigonometric functions use radians, while other functions in Core uses degrees. See the [reference manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6) for more information on what they do.

### MUIDs

MUIDs are internal identifiers for objects and assets within your game. They are guaranteed to be unique within the game and likely to be unique globally. You can copy a MUID to the clipboard automatically by right-clicking assets in the Asset Manifest or placed objects in the Hierarchy. The MUID will look something like this:

8D4B561900000092:Rabbit

The important part is the 16 digits at the start. The colon and everything after it are optional and are there to make it easier to read. Some Lua functions use MUIDs, for example `FindObjectById` and `SpawnAsset`. When used in a script, it needs to be surrounded by quotes to make it a string. For example:

```lua
local spawnTrans = script.parent:GetWorldTransform()
local anchor = World.FindObjectById('8D4B5619000000ED:Anchor')
World.SpawnAsset('8D4B561900000092:Rabbit', spawnTrans, anchor)
```
