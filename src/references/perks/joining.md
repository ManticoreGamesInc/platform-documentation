# Joining the Perks Program

## The Perks Program and Monetization

Joining the Perks Program allows Core creators to make money with their games using a complete monetization system that can be customized to any game type.

For a complete overview of the program, see the [Perks Program](../perks/program.md) introduction, and the [Perks reference](../perks/implementing.md) for instructions on how to implement them in game.

## Requirements to Join the Perks Program

To qualify to join the Perks Program, there are minimum requirements that must be met:

- Your account must be at least 30 days old and active in the last 90 days. You must also be in good standing, meaning that you have not been banned or repeatedly suspended for violating the Code of Conduct, Content Policies, or Terms of Service.
- You need to reach 50 Daily Average Users (DAU) across all your games over one month.

!!! info
    Daily Average Users counts each account that connects to your game in a day. Reaching 50 DAU in a month means a total of 1500 users, but each user counts again on a new day. To learn more about the data available at how many users are playing your games, see the [Creator Analytics](../../tutorials/creator_analytics.md) reference.

For more details about joining the program, see [Joining the Perks Program](https://support.coregames.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000105081-Joining-the-Perks-Program) in the Core Help Center. To learn about ways to improve the DAU across your games, see the [Improving Your Game](../../tutorials/improving_your_game.md) guide.
