# Mobile Device Preview

The **Device Preview** is a feature in the **Core Editor** that simulates how certain aspects of a game will appear on a mobile device. It will give creators an approximate look and feel to simulate the mobile experience for players in landscape orientation.

## Device Preview

In the editor toolbar creators will find the **Device Preview Options** button that when clicked on will open up the device preview options.

### Device Preview Menu

When creators click on the **Device Preview Options** button in the editor toolbar, an option menu will appear. This menu will allow creators to enable device preview, along with other options to customize the preview display.

#### Enable

When enabling the **Enable** option, the preview area of the editor will simulate how the game will appear on a mobile device. Creators will be able to see all the UI controls that the player can use to access settings, mounts, and emotes.

Pressing and holding the left mouse button will behave differently depending on which side of the screen it is on. If the mouse cursor is on the left side of the screen (50%), then this will handle directional movement for the player, and a virtual control will show up.

Pressing and holding on the right side of the screen will control camera movement.

#### Device frame

When enabling the **Device Frame** option, the preview area will disable the device frame. In addition to simulating the dimensions of mobile devices, it will also reflect the notch on the display.

#### Flip Notch

Using the **Flip Notch** option will toggle the notch between the left and the right side of the mobile device. Not all mobile devices have this notch, but it is important to test and ensure parts of the UI are not obstructed by the notch.
