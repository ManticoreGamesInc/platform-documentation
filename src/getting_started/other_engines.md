# Coming to Core from Other Platforms

## Overview

The purpose of this page is to let experienced game developers get started using the unique features of the Core platform.

- For a general introduction to creating with Core, see [Intro to the Core Editor](editor_intro.md)
- For a complete technical overview, see the [Core API Documentation](core_api.md).

## Unity

> Imagine starting a project with built-in multiplayer networking and a massive library of open source assets in a complete creation, publishing, and gameplay platform.

### Assets and Content

Everything used to create games in Core is made up of Core Content. While outside assets cannot be imported into Core, they can instead be built from a massive library of primitives, models, and materials.

#### Core Content

Core Content includes everything from basic shape objects to  game components like health bars and spawn points, all customizable. Objects are all downloaded with the Core install, which makes editing and playing Core-created games very fast.

#### Community Content

Original props and scenes are made by modifying Core objects, and grouping them to be treated like a single object. Packages of these groups can be shared as open-source **Templates**, similar to Unity prefabs.

### Player Controller

Core includes a player controller and third-person camera out of the box. Project previewing can be done "in person" with a moving player in the scene right away.

Players can move with the <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, and <kbd>D</kbd> keys, and change facing direction with the mouse. They can also crouch with <kbd>C</kbd>, jump with <kbd>W</kbd>, and ride a mount with <kbd>G</kbd>.

### Multiplayer

Multiplayer networking is also included in all Core projects, as well as a **Multiplayer Preview Mode** which generates up to four clients locally which can each be individually controlled for instant project testing.

Core players have consistent characters that are used across Core games with customizable outfits, emotes, and mount choices that can be overwritten for individual game artistic choices.

### Networking

Core allows straight-forward networking through the Heirarchy with **Server Context** and **Client Context** folders, and one-click networking of objects through the interface.

It also includes free server hosting and matchmaking, as well as analytics.

### Exporting Games

Core is a complete platform that includes a Launcher to see and play Core-created games. There is no executable file download or exporting, but games can be [published](publishing.md) through the editor and shared with a URL. Core showcases published games and comes with a built-in audience.

### Scripting

Core scripting is written in the [Lua](lua_reference.md) language, which does not specify data types, and is not inherently object-oriented. This allows for considerable flexibility in designing and organizing code.

Scripts can be added as children of objects, but they do not necessarily have to be associated any object, only networked and added to the project **Hierarchy**. All Lua scripts run when the project runs.

### Terminology

| **Category**  | **Unity**       | **Core**           |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| **Gameplay**  | GameObject      | CoreObject         |
|               | Prefabs         | Templates          |
| **Editor**    | Hierarchy Panel | Hierarchy          |
|               | Scene View      | Main Viewport      |
|               | Game View       | Preview Mode       |
|               | Project Browser | Project Content    |
|               | Asset Store     | Community Content (Open Source)|
|               | Terrain Editor  | Terrain            |
|               | Console         | Event Log          |
|               | Inspector       | Properties         |
| **Scripting** | C#              | Lua                |

<!-- ## World of Warcraft

Ref: <https://www.townlong-yak.com/framexml/live/>

Instead of 5.1 as in WoW, Core uses Lua 5.3.4. There have not been that many changes in the language itself but do note that many of the additions Blizzard made will be missing here.

* Trigonometry functions: As with Blizzard's versions, Core's work with degrees. Lua's standard math library works with radians.
* Events:
  The most obvious change when coming from WoW, is the event system in Core. Instead of hooking your events up to your frames, you register functions onto the events of objects.

As an example:

```lua
groupFrame:RegisterEvent("GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE")
groupFrame:RegisterEvent("PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD")
groupFrame:SetScript("OnEvent", function(self, event)
  GroupRosterUpdate()
end)
```

Would look something like this in Core:

```lua
groupFrame.GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE:Connect(GroupRosterUpdate)
groupFrame.PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD:Connect(GroupRosterUpdate)
```

Every object has a specific set of events available, but there are also custom events that you can fire via `Broadcast()` and register on the `Event` namespace:

```lua
function Foo( arg_1, arg_2)
 -- do something
end

Events.Connect(“MyEvent”, Foo)
```

more details over in the [API Docs](core_api.md).

* The often (miss)used `OnUpdate` event equivalent is the global `Tick()` function. It is totally fine to overwrite it with your own.
* Instead of frames, you will mostly work with objects in Core. Those can be destroyed completely instead of just be hidden like frames in WoW.
* Core does have `print` but it prints to the Event Log instead of the chat frame. There is no `dump` for tables.
* Core does not include the `bitlib` library.
