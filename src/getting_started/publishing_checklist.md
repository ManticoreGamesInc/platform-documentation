# Publishing Checklist

> When deciding whether to publish a game, the question is not *is this game finished* but *is this game ready to be tested by the supportive members of the Core Creator community?*

If you are ready to jump in and [publish your game](publishing.md) right away, these are the minimum questions you should consider.

1. Will players understand how to play and what the goals are?
2. Does the game have an ending, and will players have a reason to play again?
3. Does everything work, look, and sound the way you expect?
4. Have you tested the game in **Multiplayer Preview Mode**
5. Do the description and screenshots help players find the game and understand what it is?

The goal of this checklist is to outline the essentials that you should check before you publish, then give you areas to continually check as you revise and republish your game. Not everything in this list will apply to all the possible Core creations, and there will be more to consider based on the unique aspects of your design.
