# Publishing A Game

1. Locate the `Publish` button in the top right of the editor and press it.

2. Fill out all the relevant information! Give your game a name, write up a description blurb, add relevant tags, and take a screenshot for your game! For your game's screenshots, you can either take snapshots in-editor with the camera button or select an image file from your directory via the folder button.

3. Click "Publish" in the bottom right corner. Anytime you're republishing the game with changes or updates, you can follow the exact same flow, except with a "Review & Update" button instead. When your game has been successfully published, a new window will pop up!
