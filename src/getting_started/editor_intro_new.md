# Introduction to the Core Editor

## Creating a New Project

There are three options for starting a new project:

- **New Empty Project** creates a project with just the blank default elements.
- **Core Game Frameworks** include different gameplay functionality built in which can be expanded and customized.
- **Community Shared Games** are projects by Core Creators that have been shared for others to use.

## Editor Windows

The Core Editor is made up of different windows which can be resized and repositioned freely. All of the windows can be accessed and pened from the **View** tab in the top menu bar. The Editor layout be restored to its original form using the **Reset View to Default** option in the **View** menu.
