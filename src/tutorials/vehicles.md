# Vehicle Reference

## Overview

<!-- TODO: Explain what vehicle physics unlocks, and how it is different from the things you could do in the platform before -->

## Types of Vehicles

### Four Wheeled Vehicles

<!-- TODO: This can match the docs sections, just keep the explanatory examples out and focus on the barebones information -->

### Treaded Vehicles

## Vehicle Properties

<!-- TODO: This could be a table, a bunch of h3 sections, or a ul. Whatever makes it easy to find the specific info you want quickly but leaves enough space for the explanation -->

<!-- TODO: Warnings about properties that will appear to break your vehicle would be great -->

!!! info
    **Max Speed** divided by **Acceleration** is an estimate of how long it takes to get to full speed

## Wheel Properties

## Adding a Vehicle to a Project

<!-- TODO: Each step is an h3, and explanation. Pictures as much as possible -->

## Learn More

<!-- TODO: Any other doc that you link to, copy here as well. Can't think of good other references right now, but this will include the Racing Framework Tutorial once we publish that -->
