![Racing Game Framework](../img/RacingTutorial/SelectRacingFramework.png){: .center loading="lazy"}

## Testing the Racing Framework

After creating your **Racing Framework** game you should play it to make sure that everything is working. Playing the **Racing Framework** game will also familiarize you with how the system functions.

## Changing the Truck

In this section you will modify the **Pickup Truck** from the **Racing Framework**. The modifications you will make to the **Pickup Truck** can also be made to any other cars in the **Racing Framework**.

### Adding the Pickup Truck into the scene

 You first need to add the **Pickup Truck** into your hierarchy before you can modify the **Pickup Truck** template.

1. Open the **Project Content** window
2. Click on **My Templates**
3. Click on the **Cars** tab
4. Drag the **Pickup Truck** template into your **Main Viewport**

You will now see a list of car templates in the bottom window. These car templates are the same cars that you can find in the car selection area in your **Racing Framework** game.

</div>

## Changing the Look of the Pickup Truck

### Opening up the Truck

The first change to the **Pickup Truck** will change what the **Pickup Truck** looks like. You will be adding a cone on top of the **Pickup Truck**. Using the following steps you can change the **Pickup Truck** to look like anything.

!!!tip
    Click on the
    ![IconLayout](../img/RacingTutorial/IconLayout.png){: loading="lazy" style="height:2em; width:auto" .image-inline-text}
    icon or the ![ListLayout](../img/RacingTutorial/ListLayout.png){: loading="lazy" style="height:2em; width:auto" .image-inline-text} icon to switch the view type in the **Project Content**, **Core Content** or **Imported Content** windows.

You first need to expand the **Pickup Truck** in your hierarchy so that you can see what is inside of it. Click on the triangle next to the word **Pickup Truck** to open up the **Pickup Truck** in your hierarchy.

1. Open the **Client Context** folder
2. Open the folder named **Geo**
3. Open the folder named **Body**
4. Open the **Urban Car - Truck Lifted 01 (Prop)** folder
5. Open the folder named **Body**

<div class="mt-video">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/ExpandTruckHierarchy.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

The **Body** folder contains all of the pieces that make up the main body of the **Pickup Truck**. You will be adding a cone into this **Body** folder.

### Finding and Adding the Cone

You now will have to find the cone asset from the **Core Content** window.

1. Click on the **Core Content** window
2. Click on **3D Objects** tab
3. Click on the **Art Objects** tab
4. Click on the **Props** tab
5. Click on the **Urban** tab
6. Click on the **Street** tab

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/FindingTheCone.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

Now that you have found the cone asset. Drag the cone asset into the **Body** folder of your **Pickup Truck**. You will see a popup window that says **DEINSTANCE TEMPLATE** at the top. Click on the **Deinstance** button.

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/AddingConeToTruck.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

The **Pickup Truck (networked)** should now be a teal color. The teal color indicates that an object in your hierarchy is a deinstanced template.

The cone is now a part of the **Pickup Truck**. The cone was given the name **Road Cone 01 (client)**. Move the **Road Cone 01 (client)** on top of the **Pickup Truck**.

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/MoveConeOnTruck.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

## What is a Template?

A template is similar to a blueprint. A template tells Core what objects need to be instantiated when we spawn the template. You have been modifying the **Pickup Truck** template. In the Racing Game Kit in you can see multiple instances of this **Pickup Truck** template. One instance of the **Pickup Truck** template can be found at the vehicle select area. At the start of the race, one **Pickup Truck** template is spawned for each player that selects the **Pickup Truck**.

To modify a template you first have to deinstance the template (a deinstanced template will be teal). You deinstanced the **Pickup Truck** template so that you could modify the **Pickup Truck**.

## Updating the Pickup Truck Template

After you have modified the template you have to update it. One way to update a template is to select a teal object from the template and press the ![ListLayout](../img/RacingTutorial/UpdateTemplateButton.png){: loading="lazy" style="height:2em; width:auto" .image-inline-text} icon.

Another way to update a template is to right click on one of the teal objects and select **Update Template From This** from the pop up menu.

<div class="mt-video">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/UpdateTemplate.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

 You must save your project after updating a template. You can save your project by pressing ++ctrl++ + ++s++.

## Modifying the Speed of the Pickup Truck

You are not limited to only changing the appearance of the **Pickup Truck**. You can also modify different properties of the **Pickup Truck**. Specifically, you will be changing the **Max Speed** and **Acceleration** property of the **Pickup Truck** to increase the speed of the **Pickup Truck**.

To modify the **Max Speed** and **Acceleration** properties, you have to click on the object named **Pickup Truck (networked)**. You can find the **Pickup Truck (networked)** in your **Hierarchy** window.

![Pickup Truck In Hierarchy](../img/RacingTutorial/OpenTruck.png){: .center loading="lazy"}

Now that you have the **Pickup Truck (networked)** selected. In the bottom right of your screen you will see a window named **Properties**. The **Properties** window contains all of the different properties of an object.

![Pickup Truck Properties](../img/RacingTutorial/TruckProperties.png){: .center loading="lazy"}

You need to scroll down in the **Properties** window until you a section named **Vehicle**. In the **Vehicle** section you will see two properties **Max Speed** and **Acceleration**. The **Max Speed** property controls the maximum speed of the **Pickup Truck**. The **Acceleration** property of the **Pickup Truck** controls the acceleration of the **Pickup Truck**.

![Pickup Truck Speed And Acceleration](../img/RacingTutorial/TruckStats.png){: .center loading="lazy"}

Double click number 6500. Then, input a value of 25000 for the **Max Speed** property. Next, set the **Acceleration** property to 11000.

![Modifying The Truck Speed](../img/RacingTutorial/SetTruckSpeed.png){: .center loading="lazy"}

![Modifying The Truck Speed](../img/RacingTutorial/SetTruckAcceleration.png){: .center loading="lazy"}

Finally, click on the update template icon. This will update the **Pickup Truck** template to reflect the changes you made.

![UpdateTemplateIconLocation](../img/RacingTutorial/UpdateTemplateButtonLocation.png){: .center loading="lazy"}

You can now delete the **Pickup Truck (networked)** object in your hierarchy by clicking on it and pressing the ++backspace** key.

## Changing the Track

This section will cover the steps necessary to modify any track from the **Racing Framework**.

### Changing the Track Shape

In this section, you will be removing a portion of the track to change its shape.

![Plan for Road](../img/RacingTutorial/RoadPlanRemove.png){: .center loading="lazy"}

The <u>**Blue**{: style="color: rgb(23,159,227)"}</u> section represents track that will be removed from the minimap. The <u>**Orange**{: style="color: rgb(255,153,0)"}</u> section represents the track section that you will add to the track and minimap.

You will use the hotkey actions below to do the following:

1. Delete the buildings on top of the detour
2. Remove the Railings on the Curves of the track
3. Reposition the track to fill in the <u>**Orange**{: style="color: rgb(255,153,0)"}</u> section

Use the ++left-button++ of the mouse to select objects in the **Main Viewport**.

Press the ++backspace++ key to delete selected objects.

Hold the ++ctrl++ key to select multiple objects in the **Main Viewport**.

Use the ++ctrl++ + ++w++ keys to duplicate a selected object or group of selected objects.

Press the ++e++ key to display the rotate tool for a selected object.

Press the ++w++ key to display the positioning tool for a selected object.

First, you will remove the buildings that are on top of the <u>**Orange**{: style="color: rgb(255,153,0)"}</u> section.
<div class="mt-video" style="width:50%">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/DeleteBuildings.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

Next, you will remove the railings on the track.
<div class="mt-video" style="width:50%">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/RemoveRailing.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

Next, you will rotate the curved track.
<div class="mt-video" style="width:50%">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/RotateRoad.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

Next, you will reposition and duplicate the track section to fill in the gap.
<div class="mt-video" style="width:50%">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/RepositionRoad.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

### Changing the Minimap

After you have modified the track, you will need modify the minimap to display your changes to the track.

!!!tip
    Press the ++v++ key to show the **Trigger** objects in the **Main Viewport**.

The minimap uses waypoints to determine how to draw the minimap. Each waypoint is represented by a **Trigger** object. Changing the position of each **Trigger** will change the rotation and position of each road drawn on the minimap.

You will first need to open the folder named **Waypoints** that contains the triggers used as waypoints.

1. Open the **Tracks Settings** folder
2. Open the **Track 1** folder
3. Open the **Track 1 Settings** folder
4. Open the **Waypoints** folder

<div class="mt-video">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center" >
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/OpenWaypointsFolder.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

The minimap will draw a road that connects each **Trigger** to the **Trigger** below it in the **Hierarchy** window. You will be removing 3 waypoints from the **Waypoints** folder so that the minimap draws your modified version of the track.

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png" class = "center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/RacingTutorial/RemoveTriggers.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>
