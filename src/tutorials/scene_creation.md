## Tutorial

This tutorial will cover how to place and move images in a scene as well as how to customize objects to your liking. Share your decorated room on our Discord's #showcase channel!

### Downloading the Template

1. In the **Community Content** window, search for `My Room` (by Tobs) and import it in to your project.
2. Go to the **Project Content** window > **Imported Content** and find the **My Room** template. Drag it into your scene.

![!SceneCreation](../img/SceneCreation/cc.png "image_tooltip"){: .center loading="lazy" }

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay muted playsinline controls loop class="center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image6.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image6.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

!!! note "Core Concepts: The Transform Widget"
    Notice the blue, green, and red arrows - this is the **transform gizmo** and allows you to move, rotate, and scale an object in the **main viewport**.

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay muted playsinline controls loop class="center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image5.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image5.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

The arrows show the **transform gizmo** is in **translation mode**, allowing you to move any object around in the scene. You can easily switch to **translation mode** by pressing ++W++, or selecting the **translation mode** button in the **top toolbar**.

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay muted playsinline controls loop class="center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image4.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image4.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

The circles show the **transform gizmo** is in **rotation mode**, allowing you to rotate any object along the **X**, **Y**, and **Z** planes.

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay muted playsinline controls loop class="center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image9.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image9.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

The boxes show the **transform gizmo** is in **scale mode**. Clicking and dragging on any of the boxes will resize your selected object. Clicking and dragging the white center box allows you to size up and down the entire object.

You can easily switch between **translation**, **rotation**, and **scale mode** by pressing ++W++, ++E++, or ++R++ respectively, or by selecting the corresponding button in the **top toolbar**.

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay muted playsinline controls loop class="center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image8.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image8.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

### Turning off Wall Visibility

If you would like to see into the room without having to move your viewport into the room, do the following:

1. In the **Hierarchy**, open up the **My Room** group by clicking the arrow next to the **My Room** group icon.
2. Turn off the visibility of the roof and 1-2 walls by clicking the orange eye next to the corresponding assets.

### Rotating the House

Rotate the house so the interior is not in the shade. This will make it easier to see where you are placing objects.

<div class="mt-video" style="width:100%">
    <video autoplay muted playsinline controls loop class="center" style="width:100%">
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image12.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/SceneCreation/image12.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

!!! note "Core Concepts: Snap To Grid"
    Easily place and rotate objects by enabling Snap to Grid. Toggle **Snap to Grid** by pressing ++G++ or using the **Snap to Grid** button in the toolbar.

![!SceneCreation](../img/SceneCreation/image3.png "image_tooltip"){: .center loading="lazy" }

In the above image the gizmo is set to **Rotation mode** and **Snap to Grid** is enabled. The degree of rotation is set to 90, which means the selected object will be rotated by 90 degrees.

There are more degrees of rotation available in the drop down menu.

### Placing and customizing the Bed

#### Add Bed Template

Drag the bed from the **Project Content** window > **My Shared Content** > **My Room** into the scene.

!!! info "Core Tip: To snap an object to the floor press ++end++."

#### Edit Color and Material

Change the color and material of the quilt.

Select **Quilt 1** and both **Blanket Hills 1** in the Hierarchy. Go to the **Properties** tab > **Base Material**. Double click on the name of the material to open the **Material Picker**.

Change the color by clicking once on the color block - this will open the Color Picker.

Every object in Core has a material slot. You can change the color and material of everything in the scene to exactly how you want it.

If you would like to edit your materials more, check out [Custom Materials](../references/materials.md).

### Decorate

1. Check out the other furniture included with the **My Room** template and furnish the rest of the room. You can also find more room props in the **Core Content** tab > **Props** > **Urban** > **Interior**. Search **Community Content** to find furnishings from other creators or make and upload your own!
2. Take a screenshot of your room and post it on the `#showcase` channel in Core's :fontawesome-brands-discord: [Creator Discord](https://forums.coregames.com/t/discord-server/66/).
