# Templates in Core

## Overview

Have you made something awesome or weird? Want to use it in your other future projects? What about letting others use it in their own games? One of the best parts about Core is the ability to create and share what we make as **templates** for ourselves and for others to download.

Collaboration is an important aspect of art and design as well as key to developing rich and unique games. Templates can be created, shared, and updated in real time across the platform.

When one template is updated, it updates every instance of the template. So you could make a castle using a complex tower template, make a change to one tower, update the template, and then all other towers will be updated automatically for you.

Templates can be identified in the **Project Content** window by this icon: ![TemplateIcon](../img/EditorManual/UI/templateicon.png "Templates are signified by a set of three cubes."){: .image-inline-text .image-background}

## Creating Templates

### Create a Template from a Group

1. Right click the group and select **Create New Template from This**.
2. Name your template and click the **New Template** button.

### Create a Template from Separate Objects

1. If the assets are not in the **Hierarchy**, drag them from **Project Content** onto the **Hierarchy** or **Main Viewport**.
2. Select the assets to be added to the template in the **Hierarchy** window using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + left click.
3. Right click on them and select **Group and Create New Template from These**.
4. Name your template and click the **New Template** button.

Once a group becomes a template, it will appear in blue in the Hierarchy. New templates can be found in the **Project Content** window. From there you can drag out as many copies of the template as needed.

## Publishing Templates

Once your template is created, you may use it for just this project alone, or you can now further publish the template to **Community Content** for sharing with others and between different projects.

### Open the Publishing Dialogue

1. Find the template in the **Project Content** window.
2. Click the **Publish Content** button in the Properties menu.

     ![Publish](../img/EditorManual/UI/PublishToCC_properts.png "Or publish via the Properties window!"){: .center}

!!! note
You can also right click the template and select **Publish to Community Content**

### Name and Describe the Template

![Publish Dialog Box](../img/EditorManual/Art/PublishtoCCBox.png "Fill this up with info about your template."){: .center}

1. Give the template a name. This does not need to match the template name in the project, and can be more descriptive or specific help creators understand the template.
2. Write a **description** for your template. This section can include list of the individual objects in the template, possible uses, and attributions to other creators who helped with the template.

### Add a Screenshot

Screenshots are the most effective way to showcase a template, and help others understand what it is.

#### Upload a Screenshot

Uploading a screen shot allows you to use an external image editing software to improve your screenshot. This can be most useful when you need to convey for abstract information, like what a script does.

  1. Use the <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> key to copy a screenshot to your clipboard.
  2. Paste the captured image into an image editor, and save the file when you have finished editing it.
  3. Select the **Screenshots** button to upload a screenshot from your computer.

#### Use the Screenshot Tool

c. Mark your **permissions** as either public or private. If private, only you can see the template in Community Content. If public, the template can be seen and used by everyone on the platform.
d. **Release notes** are useful as you update and re-publish your template, so that you may explain what changes you have made!
e. **Tags** are great for helping your template be found easier in Community Content.
f.

1. Click **Review & Publish** and review your settings. Don't worry about it being perfect, as this may all be edited after publishing.

2. Click **Publish**.

   While still within **Project Content**, the template's white name should now be green and the template can be found and downloaded from **Community Content**. From there, anyone can download your template and use it for even more awesome content! Of course, this is only if you set your template to *public*.

   By setting your template to *private*, only you will be able to download it from Community Content into other projects. This can be very handy for working on a template on different computers without having to publish the work-in-progress version of what you are making.

Congratulations! You've created, edited, and published a template that can be shared and used by other creators in Core!

### Changing and Updating Templates

#### Deinstance a Template

One of the huge benefits of templates is being able to update many objects at the same time! When using several of the same template, changes can be made to one and then automatically sent to update all the others.

<div class="mt-video">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png">
        <source src="/img/EditorManual/Art/updateTemplate.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/EditorManual/Art/updateTemplate.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

You will notice when making changes to a template, it will ask if you would like to "**Deinstance**" the template. Click "**Yes**" when this prompt appears.
A deinstanced template will have text color change from *blue*{: style="color: var(--core-color-templetized)"} to *teal*{: style="color: var(--core-color-deinstanced)"}. It is still a template, but has changes that the other instances of this template will not.

Once you have made changes you would like to send to all other instances of the template, right click the altered template. Click "**Update Template From This**" to send changes. All the templates will now match the updated one!

<div class="mt-video">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png">
        <source src="/img/EditorManual/Art/updateTempFromThis.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/EditorManual/Art/updateTempFromThis.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

This will update the template for your project personally, but in order to update a template that has been published to **Community Content**, we will need to re-publish the template.

In your **Project Content**, find the published template that you wish to update. Right click the template, and click "**Republish**". It'll bring up the same window as for publishing a template, so that you may update the description if you like.

![Republish](../img/EditorManual/Art/RepublishTemplate.png "Republish"){: .center}

"**Download Latest**" will update your local project template with whatever the most recent published version of the template exists on **Community Content**.

#### I Change My Mind: Resetting a Deinstanced Template

When you make a change to an instance of a template, the text turns *teal*{: style="color: var(--core-color-deinstanced)"} and it is "**Deinstanced**". There might be times when you don't like the changes you've made, and you would like to return to your original template.

To do this, right click the template within the Hierarchy and select "**Reset to Template**". This will revert the template back to the original design!

---

#### Downloading & Using Other Creator's Templates

Templates made by other people can be downloaded from **Community Content** and re-used as anything you like. This is a great way to focus on getting to your final idea faster than creating everything from scratch!

If you wish to publish a re-used template to Community Content, it must be as its own new and separate template.
