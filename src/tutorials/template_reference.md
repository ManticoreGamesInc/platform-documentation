# Templates in Core

## Overview

**Templates** are a way to create convenient, reusable packages in Core. They can be single modified 3D objects, complex objects, scripts, completely scripted objects, or collections of all of these.

Templates can be identified in the **Project Content** window by this icon: ![TemplateIcon](../img/EditorManual/UI/templateicon.png "Templates are signified by a set of three cubes."){: .image-inline-text .image-background}

### When to Use Templates

- **Saving templates locally** allows you to make changes across every copy of the template across a project. When one template is updated, it updates every instance of the template.
- **Publishing a template privately** allows you to import the template into other projects, re-using assets across games.
- **Publicly publishing templates** adds them to **Community Content** for others to use and modify for their own projects. This allows multiple creators to work on a template, adding different variations, or more functionality.

## Creating Templates

To learn how to create groups and folders, see the [Complex Objects reference](modeling_reference.md).

### Create a Template from a Group

1. Right click the group and select **Create New Template from This**.
2. Name your template and click the **New Template** button.

### Create a Template from Separate Objects

1. If the assets are not in the **Hierarchy**, drag them from **Project Content** onto the **Hierarchy** or **Main Viewport**.
2. Select the assets to be added to the template in the **Hierarchy** window using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + left click.
3. Right click on them and select **Group and Create New Template from These**.
4. Name your template and click the **New Template** button.

Once a group becomes a template, it will appear in blue in the Hierarchy. New templates can be found in the **Project Content** window. From there you can drag out as many copies of the template as needed.

## Publishing Templates

Once your template is created, you may use it for just this project alone, or you can now further publish the template to **Community Content** for sharing with others and between different projects.

### Open the Publishing Dialogue

1. Find the template in the **Project Content** window.
2. Click the **Publish Content** button in the Properties menu.

     ![Publish](../img/EditorManual/UI/PublishToCC_properts.png "Or publish via the Properties window!"){: .center}

!!! note
    You can also right click the template and select **Publish to Community Content**

### Name and Describe the Template

![Publish Dialog Box](../img/EditorManual/Art/PublishtoCCBox.png "Fill this up with info about your template."){: .center}

1. Give the template a name. This does not need to match the template name in the project, and can be more descriptive or specific help creators understand the template.
2. Write a **description** for your template. This section can include list of the individual objects in the template, possible uses, and attributions to other creators who helped with the template.

### Add a Screenshot

Screenshots are the most effective way to showcase a template, and help others understand what it is.

#### Upload a Screenshot

Uploading a screen shot allows you to use an external image editing software to improve your screenshot. This can be most useful when you need to convey for abstract information, like what a script does.

  1. Use the <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> key to copy a screenshot to your clipboard.
  2. Paste the captured image into an image editor, and save the file when you have finished editing it.
  3. Select the **Screenshots** button to upload a screenshot from your computer.

#### Use the Screenshot Tool

### Publish to Community Content

1. Mark your **permissions** as either public or private.
      - **Private** templates can only be seen in **Community Content** by the creator who published them.
      - **Public** templates can be seen and used by everyone in **Community Content**.
2. Click **Review & Publish** and review your settings. Don't worry about it being perfect, as this may all be edited after publishing.
3. Click **Publish**.

In **Project Content**, the template's name should turn from white to green.

![TemplateTut4](../img/EditorManual/UI/greenUserTemplate.png "Your template has been greenlit!"){: .center}

You can search for the published template in the **Community Content** window. Templates are displayed chronologically, so it will most likely be at the top of the list.

## Changing and Updating Templates

Once a 3D model is made into a template, it will resist changes besides positioning and resizing all of its dimensions together to preserve its basic shape. To make changes to the materials, dimensions, or individual pieces of a template, it will need to be **deinstanced**.

!!! info "What is an instance?"
    A template can be understood as a recipe. Each time the recipe is made, that product is an **instance** of the template. **Deinstancing** would be making a change in the final product of the recipe, so that it is now different from the exact copies of the recipe. Changing the recipe itself -- updating the template -- should change every single instance of the recipe.

<div class="mt-video">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png">
        <source src="/img/EditorManual/Art/updateTemplate.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/EditorManual/Art/updateTemplate.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

To make changes to a template, you will need to first **deinstance** it. This can be done automatically by making a change to a the template.

1. Make a change to a component or property of an object in the template.
2. Click **Yes** when the prompt appears asking if you want to deinstance the template.

A deinstanced template will change color from blue to teal. Changes made to a deinstanced template will not affect other copies of the template.

### Update All Template Copies

To change all of the instances of a template, you will need to deinstance and modify an instance of the template, and then update the others to match it.

![Update Template](../img/EditorManual/Art/updateTemplate.gif "Update Template"){: .center}

1. Right click on a deinstanced template with the latest changes.
2. Click **Update Template From This** to update all the instances of the template to match it.

<div class="mt-video">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="/img/EditorManual/Abilities/Gem.png">
        <source src="/img/EditorManual/Art/updateTempFromThis.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/EditorManual/Art/updateTempFromThis.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

### Republish a Template

Updating templates with change all the instances in your game, but to update the version that has been published to **Community Content**, we will need to re-publish the template.

1. In your **Project Content** window.
2. Find the **My Shared Content** folder on the right side.
3. Right click the template, and select **Republish**.
4. In the publishing prompt, add a description of the most recent changes to the **Release Notes** section, so that creators know what to expect.

![Republish](../img/EditorManual/Art/RepublishTemplate.png "Republish"){: .center}

Creators will be able to get updates to the template by right-clicking the template and selecting **Download Latest**.

### Reset a Deinstanced Template

Another benefit of templates is creating a saved version of an model that can be restored.

To revert the template back to the original design, right click the template within the **Hierarchy** and select **Reset to Template**.

## Using Templates from Other Creators

Templates made by other creators can be imported from **Community Content** and used in a project or modified and published as a new template.

To learn more about importing and using **Community Content** templates, see the [Community Content reference](community_content.md).
