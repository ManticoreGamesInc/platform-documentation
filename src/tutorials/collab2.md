# Back Up Your Project Using GitHub

## Overview

Core projects are saved locally on your computer, and therefore if you
want to move them between computers, or share the project file with someone else, you will need a way to upload them.

Core project files are actually quite small, so it is possible to just upload them to any cloud server. What using **GitHub** will allow you to do is synchronize changes to an online version, and keep a history of the changes. You can go back to an older version, back up your project, and collaborate with others on the same project.

## The Core Project File

Core project files, called **Maps** are stored in a different place from the Core Editor and Launcher.

### Open the Project File

There are two ways to find your project folder: the normal way you would find any file saved on your computer using the **File Explorer**, and directly from the **Core Editor** itself.

#### Using the File Explorer

1. Open **My Documents**
2. Find and open the folder called **My Games**
3. Inside, you should find a folder called **Core** (it may be **CORE**).
4. Open the **Saved** folder
5. Open the **Maps** folder
6. In this folder, you should one folder for each saved project in the Core Editor.
