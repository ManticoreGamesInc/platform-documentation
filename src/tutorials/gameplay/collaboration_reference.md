# Templates in CORE

!!! warning
    Flagged for Review.
    Incomplete or outdated information may be present.

## Overview

Have you made something awesome or weird? Want to use it in your other future projects? What about letting others use it in their own games? One of the best parts about CORE is the ability to create and share what we make as **templates** for ourselves and for others to download.

Collaboration is an important aspect of art and design as well as key to developing rich and unique games. Templates can be created, shared, and updated in real time across the platform.

When one template is updated, it updates every instance of the template. So you could make a castle using a complex tower template, make a change to one tower, update the template, and then all other towers will be updated automatically for you.

Templates can be identified in the **CORE Content** tab by this icon: ![TemplateIcon](../../img/EditorManual/UI/templateicon.png "Templates are signified by a set of three cubes."){: .center}

## Tutorial

### Creating A Template

Creating a template is fast and easy! To make a template follow these steps:

1. Drag in your assets from CORE Content. Arrange and organize them how you'd like.

     Templates can contain 3D objects, scripts, vfx, or whatever you want to combine.

2. When satisfied with your creation, select all assets in the project Hierarchy tab that you desire to be in the template. Right click on them and select "Group and Create New Template from These".

     ![TemplateTut1](../../img/EditorManual/UI/TemplateTut1.png "image_tooltip"){: .center}

    Alternatively you can group the assets first and then create the template. You'll find that like a lot of game development software, there are multiple ways to go about achieving a task. The process is whichever comes natural to you!

3. Name your template and click the **New Template** button.

     ![TemplateTut2](../../img/EditorManual/UI/TemplateTut2.png "image_tooltip"){: .center}

     The template is now recognized in your project as its own object and can be found in the Project Content folder of CORE Content and you may quickly and easily drag out multiple instances into your scene.

     Once your template is created, you may use it for just this project alone, or you can now publish the template to Community Content. Once something becaomes a template, it's name changes to **blue**{: style="color: blue"} text.

### Publishing Your Template

1. Click on your template in the Project Content Folder of CORE Content.

2. You may either right click and select Publish to Community Content OR click the Publish to Community Content button in the Properties menu.

     ![Publish](../../img/EditorManual/Art/publishToCC.png "Publish"){: .center}

3. This dialogue box will appear:

     ![Publish Dialog Box](../../img/EditorManual/Art/PublishtoCCBox.png "Publish Dialog Box"){: .center}

     a. Check or create a new **template name**.

     b. Write a **description** for your template.

     c. Mark your **permissions** as either public or private. If private, only you can see the template in Community Content. If public, the template can be seen and used by everyone on the platform.

     d. **Release notes** are useful as you update and re-publish your template, so that you may explain what changes you have made!

     e. **Tags** are great for helping your template be found easier in Community Content.

     f. **Screenshots** for glamour and fame!

4. Click Review & Publish and review your settings. Don't worry about it being perfect, as this may all be edited after publishing.

5. Click Publish.

   The template's white name should now be green and the template can be found and downloaded from Community Content. From here, you may edit, re-download or delete templates you've published!

   ![TemplateTut4](../../img/EditorManual/UI/TemplateTut6.png "image_tooltip"){: .center}

Congratulations! You've created, edited, and published a template that can be shared and used by other creators in CORE!

### Tips and Tricks with Templates

#### Deinstancing Templates

Once your template is created, you must "deinstance" it in order to edit the template again. Deinstancing a template still keeps its reference in mind, but allows you to make changes so that you can re-update or re-upload the template.

To deinstance a template, right click and select "Deinstance this object".

![TemplateTut5](../../img/EditorManual/UI/TemplateTut7.png "image_tooltip"){: .center}

The object's name will now be blue and you may edit the template as you wish!
Don't like the changes you made? You can always select "Reset to Template" to restore back to the original template.

#### Updating Templates

Have tons of instances of a template in your scene but you want to do something as minor as change their material? Have no fear! With templates, you can make changes and update every instance of that template in your scene at once.

Updating templates is based only in your project. If you wish to update a template across the platform, you must select the template in the Project Content Folder and click the Republish button in the Properties menu.

To update a template, simply right click on an altered template, deinstanced or not and select "Update template from this". You should be able to see all the instances of that template change in your scene!

#### Downloading Latest

If another creator has re-published their template across the platform, in order to assign the changes to the template in your project you must download the latest version of the shared template.

To download the latest template, either right click on the template in Asset Manifest and select Download Latest OR select the template and click the Download Latest Button.
