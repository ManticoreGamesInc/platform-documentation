# Collaboration & Source Control in CORE

## Overview

Working on projects with multiple people can get complicated. Now we live in the future, where *souce control* exists.

**Source control** is a way to maintain history of your projects. You can save files and make changes, but if you soon realize something went very wrong and everything is broken in your more recent changes to the project, you can use source control to return to an earlier & working version of your project. This can save months of time, with big or complex projects--or even for a solo project!

Some of the most common platforms for source control are **Github** *(Git)* and **Perforce** *(P4V)*, and in this tutorial we'll go over the more straightforward and quickly accesible of the two--source control using Git.

!!! info "Whatever works, works!"
    There are many different kinds of source control--the term just means backing up your project as you save so that you can "go back in time" if you need to.

### Collaboration in CORE Only

If you're not too worried about making mistakes, or just want to share quick things, CORE has many ways to share content already built-in.

If you're working with multiple people, instead of using "formal" source control, you could just publish templates to **Community Content** and have your teammates access what you make that way.

You can also publish your games privately, so that only people you give the link to can play and view it.

To read more about how to do this, check out the [Templates](../../gameplay/collaboration_reference/) tutorial or [publish private]
