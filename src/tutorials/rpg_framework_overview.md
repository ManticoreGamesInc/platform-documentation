## The D&D Game Jam Contest Framework

Core has created a framework to give you a quick start to building a complete RPG and for the [D&D Contest](https://dndcontest.coregames.com/). It is not necessary to use this framework to participate, but these resources will help you start a project using the framework.

## Contents

- The [D&D Contest Framework Reference](rpg_framework_reference.md) details all the parts of the frameworks and what they do.
- The [D&D Contest Framework Tutorial](first_game_rpg.md) will walk you through building a game.
- The [D&D Game Jam Documentation](rpg_framework_documentation.md) is the official documentation included with the framework.
