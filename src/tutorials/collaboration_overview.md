# Collaboration in Core

## Introduction

Core is an ecosystem of games with creator tools designed to allow players to jump quickly through many different games. Each game's success helps other games, so the Core community is very collaborative and helpful to new creators, and there are resources within the Core Editor to make collaboration on projects easy.

This document will discuss ways to structure projects to work with a team as collaborators, and detail the tools, in and out of Core, that will let you succeed in creating successful projects with a team.

### You Can Do It All

Teams are a part of traditional game development, but Core also makes it possible for an individual to do every part of a project, from the art to programming to post-publication promotion! Whether you build as an individual or a team is entirely up to you!

### Core Project Files are Saved Locally

All of your Core projects, called **Maps** are files saved on your computer, so they can be zipped and distributed the same way you would any file. Project files are very small, so they are easy to send through e-mail and chat programs, especially when compressed to a ``.zip`` file.

#### Making a Zipped Map

1. Find your Core Maps by opening **Documents** > **My Games** > **CORE** > **Saved** > **Maps**
2. Here you will find a folder for each of the Core projects that has been created on your machine.
3. Right-click the folder you want to compress, scroll down to **Send to** and select **Compressed (zipped) folder**.
4. This will create a zipped folder in the same directory, with the same name.

#### Opening a Zipped Map in Core

1. Find your Core Maps by opening **Documents** > **My Games** > **CORE** > **Saved** > **Maps**.
2. Move the **.zip** folder that you want to open into this folder.
3. Right-click the folder and select **Extract all**.
4. Save the extracted folder in the same place, with the same name as the extract file.
5. In the Core Launcher, open the **Create** tab, and you should find a project by the same name there.

## Collaboration with the Core Community

### Using Community-Created Content

Core creators have made a vast array of models, utilities, and even complete games that are freely available for you to use in your own projects. **Community Content** can be imported from within the Core Editor, and allows you to gather assets and utilities in your game, as well as share things you make with other creators.

#### The Community Content Window
- Community Content
- Open Games

### Getting Support from the Community

- Discord
- Bounty Board

## Working with Teams

### Project Roles

Games are made using a wide variety of different skills, and one of the greatest benefits of collaborating with a team is allowing each member to focus on a specific skill set. On a Core project, people generally do more than one role, but this list can be used to divide up the work of maintaining a project over time.

### Management

- Project Manager
    Keeps track of all the work that needs to be done to get the project to the next stage, usually setting deadlines and leading meetings where team members sync up about the current status of their individual tasks
- Community Manager


### Programming

Note about modular structure of much of Core, easily have more than one person working on programming

### Design

- Game Designer
- Level Designer
- Narrative Designer / Writer
- UI Designer

### Art

- Environment Artist
- Lighting Artist
- Asset Artist
- Graphic Designer

### Useful Tools

- Discord
- Trello

## Methods of Collaboration

### Templates and Community Content

- Template introductory explanation
- Link to template resource

#### Sharing Templates without Community Content

<!-- Update publishing template, and better surface -->

1. Make it a template
2. Export the template (opens file system)
3. Send the TemplateName.pbt to another user, or move it yourself

### Github

- Branches
- Tree.pbt file

### Cloud Drives

- making a zip file of your project
- Core files are pretty small, so this is doable.
- Disadvantage, everyone has to take turns making changes

### VSCode Liveshare

- Link to using an external editor
