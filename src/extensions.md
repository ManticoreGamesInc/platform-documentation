# Editor Extensions

There are a bunch of ways you can improve the experience of scripting in Core. If you are happy with the in-built editor, feel free to skip this section.

## External editors

There are of course several good editors out there for Lua development, but we suggest one of the following since they have tons of good plugins available.

| Name                                                                    | Details                                             | Core Autocomplete | Price                  |

### Plugins / Extensions

For Visual Studio Code and Atom, we have collected a few extensions that make developing in Core and Lua easier:

#### Visual Studio Code

| Plugin Name                                                                            | Details                  |

### Autocomplete

We provide autocompletion files with all Core API for VS Code, Atom and every other editor that supports `.luacompleterc`:

#### Visual Studio Code & Atom

* :fontawesome-solid-download: Download: [luacompleterc.zip](./assets/api/luacompleterc.zip "API Autocomplete Files")
* :fontawesome-solid-angle-double-right: Install: Extract the `.luacompleterc` file to your `Documents\My Games\Core\Saved\Maps` folder.

!!! note "Note for Visual Studio Code:"
    You need to add the folder containing `.luacompleterc` to the library settings of the Lua Language Server extension.
    To do this, open up the VS Code settings via <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, type "Open Settings (JSON)" and hit enter.

    Now add the following to the end:

    ```json
    "Lua.workspace.library": { "C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\Documents\\My Games\\Core\\Saved\\Maps": true },
    "Lua.diagnostics.enable": false,
    ```

    We are setting Lua diagnostics to `false` since we are going to use the Luacheck integration that comes with VSCode-Lua.

### Installing a Linter

[Luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck), which also serves as a static analyzer, is **the** Lua Linter to use. You can add a `.luacheckrc` config file to your project that tells it what to check for and it will point out any mistakes you may make. Check out their [documentation](https://luacheck.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more info. A statically linked binary with all deps included is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck/releases/).

* :fontawesome-solid-download: Download: [Luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck/releases/)
* :fontawesome-solid-angle-double-right: Install: Copy `luacheck.exe` to a folder and add it to your `PATH` environment variable. ([HowTo](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/))

In addition, we provide a `.luacheckrc` settings file with all Core API whitelisted so they don't show up as undeclared global variables:

* :fontawesome-solid-download: Download: [luacheckrc.zip](./assets/api/luacheckrc.zip "luacheckrc.zip")
* :fontawesome-solid-angle-double-right: Install: Extract the `.luacheckrc` file to your `C:\\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\My Games\Core\Saved\Maps` folder.
