## Branch Structure

There are multiple version of the Core documentation, and therefore multiple branches on this repository that correspond to each.

- [development](https://development.docs.coregames.com) - the staging site, accessible at [https://development.docs.coregames.com](https://development.docs.coregames.com).
- [production](https://docs.coregames.com) - the live site, accessible at [https://docs.coregames.com](https://docs.coregames.com).

Note: `production` is a protected branch and _cannot_ be pushed to directly! Instead, all changes must go through the `development` branch which gets then merged into `production` via an approval process by the documentation team.

In addition, we use **Netlify** to generate preview pages for every pull request and branch. Those URLs will be listed in the status window on every pull request.
