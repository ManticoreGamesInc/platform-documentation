## Branch Structure

There are multiple version of the Core documentation, and therefore multiple branches on this repository that correspond to each.

Production:

- [production](https://dev.manticoreplatform.com/docs/) - the staging site, accessible at [https://dev.manticoreplatform.com/docs/](https://dev.manticoreplatform.com/docs/).
- [production-publish](https://www.coregames.com/docs/) - the live site, accessible at [https://www.coregames.com/docs/](https://www.coregames.com/docs/)

In addition, we use Netlify to generate preview pages for every pull request and branch. Those URLs will be listed in the status window on every pull request.

### Branch Details

Each state of the published website is a corresponding branch-pair on GitHub, a commit-able version and a `*-publish` version.

So the pair of `production` and `production-publish` is one example. The `*-publish` version is a protected branch and _cannot_ be pushed to directly!

Instead, all changes must go through the main branch (`production`), then merged into the publish one (`production-publish`) via an approval process by the documentation team.

This ensures quality on all public sources of documentation.

When a branch is merged to `*-publish`, it will use `--no-ff`, so as to not clutter up the history, and simply allow upstream commits for builds.
